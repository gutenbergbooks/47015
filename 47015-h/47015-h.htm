</div>

<p class='c007' >Eleven years have elapsed since the writer’s first
work on Mars was published in which were recorded
the facts gleaned in his research up to that time
and in which was set forth a theory of their explanation.
Continued work in the interval has confirmed
the conclusions there stated; sometimes in quite
unexpected ways. Five times during that period
Mars has approached the earth within suitable scanning
distance and been subjected to careful and
prolonged scrutiny. Familiarity with the subject,
improved telescopic means, and long-continued training
have all combined to increased efficiency in the
procuring of data and to results which have been
proportionate. A mass of new material has thus
been collected,—some of it along old lines, some of
it in lines that are themselves new,—and both have
led to the same outcome. In addition to thus pushing
inquiry into advanced portions of the subject,
study has been spent in investigation of the reality
of the phenomena upon which so much is based, and
in testing every theory which has been suggested to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_viii' id='Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
account for them. From diplopia to optical interference,
each of these has been examined and found
incompatible with the observations. The phenomena
are all they have been stated to be, and more. Each
step forward in observation has confirmed the genuineness
of those that went before.</p>

<p class='c008' >To set forth science in a popular, that is, in a
generally understandable, form is as obligatory as to
present it in a more technical manner. If men are
to benefit by it, it must be expressed to their comprehension.
To do this should be feasible for him
who is master of his subject and is both the best
test of, and the best training to, that post. Especially
vital is it that the exposition should be done
at first hand; for to describe what a man has himself
discovered comes as near as possible to making
a reader the co-discoverer of it. Not only are thus
escaped the mistaken glosses of second-hand knowledge,
but an aroma of actuality, which cannot be
filtered through another mind without sensible evaporation,
clings to the account of the pioneer. Nor
is it so hard to make any well-grasped matter comprehensible
to a man of good general intelligence as
is commonly supposed. The whole object of science
is to synthesize, and so simplify; and did we but
know the uttermost of a subject we could make it
singularly clear. Meanwhile technical phraseology,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_ix' id='Page_ix'>ix</a></span>
useful as shorthand to the cult, becomes meaningless
jargon to the uninitiate and is paraded most by the
least profound. But worse still for their employ
symbols tend to fictitious understanding. Formulæ
are the anæsthetics of thought, not its stimulants;
and to make any one think is far better worth while
than cramming him with ill-considered, and therefore
indigestible, learning.</p>

<p class='c008' >Even to the technical student, a popular book, if
well done, may yield most valuable results. For nothing
in any branch of science is so little known as its
articulation,—how the skeleton of it is put together,
and what may be the mode of attachment of its
muscles.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c015'     >From time immemorial travel and discovery
have called with strange insistence to him who,
wondering on the world, felt adventure in his veins.
The leaving familiar sights and faces to push forth into
the unknown has with magnetic force drawn the bold
to great endeavor and fired the thought of those who
stayed at home. Spur to enterprise since man first
was, this spirit has urged him over the habitable globe.
Linked in part to mere matter of support it led the
more daring of the Aryans to quit the shade of their
beech trees, reposeful as that umbrage may have been,
and wander into Central Asia, so to perplex philologists
into believing them to have originated there;
it lured Columbus across the waste of waters and
caused his son to have carved upon his tomb that
ringing couplet of which the simple grandeur still
stirs the blood:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Á Castilla y á Leon</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Nuevo mondo dió Colon;</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(To Castile and Leon beyond the wave</div>
      <div class='line'>Another world Columbus gave;)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
it drove the early voyagers into the heart of the vast
wilderness, there to endure all hardship so that they
might come where their kind had never stood before;
and now it points man to the pole.</p>

<p class='c008' >Something of the selfsame spirit finds a farther
field today outside the confines of our traversable
earth. Science which has caused the world to shrink
and dwindle has been no less busy bringing near what
in the past seemed inaccessibly remote. Beyond our
earth man’s penetration has found it possible to pierce,
and in its widening circle of research has latterly been
made aware of another world of strange enticement
across the depths of space. Planetary distances, not
mundane ones, are here concerned, and the globe to be
explored, though akin to, is yet very different from,
our own. This other world is the planet Mars.
Sundered from us by the ocean of ether, a fellow-member
of our own community of matter there makes
its circuit of the sun upon whose face features show
which stamp it as cognate to that on which we live.
In spite of the millions of miles of intervening matterless
void, upon it markings can be made out that
distantly resemble our earth’s topography and grow
increasingly suggestive as vision shapes them better;
and yet among the seemingly familiar reveal aspects
which are completely strange. But more than this:
over the face of it sweep changes that show it to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
not a dead but a living world, like ours in this, and
luring curiosity by details unknown here to further
exploration of its unfamiliar ground.</p>

<p class='c008' >To observe Mars is to embark upon this enterprise;
not in body but in mind. Though parted by a gulf
more impassable than any sea, the telescope lets us
traverse what otherwise had been barred and lands us
at last above the shores we went forth to seek. Real
the journey is, though incorporeal in kind. Since the
seeing strange sights is the essence of all far wanderings,
it is as truly travel so the eye arrive as if the body
kept it company. Indeed, sight is our only far viatic
sense. Touch and taste both hang on contact, smell
stands indebted to the near and even hearing waits on
ponderable matter where sound soon dissipates away;
only sight soars untrammeled of the grosser adjunct of
the flesh to penetrate what were otherwise unfathomable
space.</p>

<p class='c008' >What the voyager thus finds himself envisaging
shares by that very fact in the expansion of the sense
that brought him there. No longer tied by means of
transport to seas his sails may compass or lands his
feet may tread, the traveler reaches a goal removed in
kind from his own habitat. He proves to have adventured,
not into unknown parts of a known world,
but into one new to him in its entirety. In extent
alone he surveys what dwarfs the explorer’s conquests
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
on Earth. But size is the least of the surprises there
in store for him. What confronts his gaze finds commonly
no counterpart on Earth. His previous knowledge
stands him in scant stead. For he faces what is
so removed from every day experience that analogy no
longer offers itself with safety as a guide. He must
build up new conceptions from fresh data and slowly
proceed to deduce the meaning they may contain.
Science alone can help him to interpretation of what
he finds, and above all must he wean himself from
human prejudice and earthbound limitation. For he
deals here with ultramundane things. With just
enough of cosmogony in common to make decipherment
not despairable this world is yet so different
from the one he personally knows as to whet curiosity
at every turn. He is permitted to perceive what
piques inquiry and by patient adding of point to point
promises at last a rational result.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like mundane exploration, it is arduous too; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
astra per aspera</span></i> is here literally true. For it is a
journey not devoid of hardship and discomfort by the
way. Its starting-point preludes as much. To get
conditions proper for his work the explorer must forego
the haunts of men and even those terrestrial spots found
by them most habitable. Astronomy now demands
bodily abstraction of its devotee. Its deities are gods
that veil themselves amid man-crowded marts and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
impose withdrawal and seclusion for the prosecution of
their cult as much as any worshiped for other reason
in more primeval times. To see into the beyond requires
purity; in the medium now as formerly in the
man. As little air as may be and that only of the
best is obligatory to his enterprise, and the securing it
makes him perforce a hermit from his kind. He must
abandon cities and forego plains. Only in places raised
above and aloof from men can he profitably pursue
his search, places where nature never meant him to
dwell and admonishes him of the fact by sundry
hints of a more or less distressing character. To
stand a mile and a half nearer the stars is not to
stand immune.</p>

<p class='c008' >Thus it comes about that today besides its temples
erected in cities, monasteries in the wilds are being
dedicated to astronomy as in the past to faith; monasteries
made to commune with its spirit, as temples
are to communicate the letter of its law. Pioneers in
such profession, those already in existence are but the
precursors of many yet to come as science shall more
and more recognize their need. Advance in knowledge
demands what they alone can give. Primitive,
too, they must be as befits the still austere sincerity
of a cult, in which the simplest structures are found
to be the best.</p>

<p class='c008' >Still the very wildness of the life their devotee is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
forced to lead has in it a certain fittingness for his post
in its primeval detachment from the too earthbound,
in concept as in circumstance. Withdrawn from contact
with his kind, he is by that much raised above
human prejudice and limitation. To sally forth into
the untrod wilderness in the cold and dark of a
winter’s small hours of the morning, with the snow feet
deep upon the ground and the frosty stars for mute
companionship, is almost to forget one’s self a man
for the solemn awe of one’s surroundings. Fitting
portal to communion with another world, it is through
such avenue one enters on his quest where the common
and familiar no longer jostle the unknown and
the strange. Nor is the stillness of the stars invaded
when some long unearthly howl, like the wail of a lost
soul, breaks the slumber of the mesa forest, marking
the prowling presence of a stray coyote. Gone as it
came, it dies in the distance on the air that gave it
birth; and the gloom of the pines swallows up one’s
vain peering after something palpable, their tops alone
decipherable in dark silhouette against the sky. From
amid surroundings that for their height and their
intenancy fringe the absolute silence of space the
observer must set forth who purposes to cross it to
another planetary world.</p>

<div id='i_008fp' class='figcenter'>

<p><i>The Hermitage</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >But the isolation of his journey is not always so forbidding.
His coming back is no less girt with grandeur
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
of a different though equally detached a kind. Even
before the stars begin to dim in warning to him to return,
a faint suffusion as of half-suspected light creeps
into the border of the eastern sky. Against it, along
the far pine-clad horizon, mesa after mesa in shaggy
lines of sentineling earth, stands forth dark marshaled
in the gloom, informed with prescience of what is soon
to come. Imperceptibly the pallor grows, blanching
the face of night and one by one extinguishing the stars.
Slowly then it takes on color, tingeing ever so faintly
to a flush that swells and deepens as the minutes pass.
One had said the sky lay dreaming of the sun in pale
imagery at first that gathers force and feeling till the
dreamer turns thus rosy red in slumbering supposition
of reality. Then the blush dies out. The crimson fades
to pink, the pink to ashes. The stars have disappeared
and yet it is not day. It is the supreme moment of the
dawn, the hush with which the Earth awaits its full
awakening. For now again the color gathers in the east,
not with the impalpable suffusion it had before but
nearer and more vivid. No longer reflectively remote,
rays imminent of the sun strike the upper air, the most
adventurously refrangible turning the underside of a
few stray clouds into flame-hued bars of glowing metal.
They burn thus in the silent east first red, then orange,
and then gold, each spectral tint in prismatic revelation
coming to join the next till in a sudden
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
blinding burst of splendor the solar disk tops the
horizon’s rim.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not less impressive is the journey when the afternoon
watch has replaced the morning vigil by the drawing of
the planet nearer to the sun. Lost in the brilliance of
the dazzling sky, the planet lies hid from the senses’
search. The quest were hopeless did not the mind guide
the telescope to its goal. To theory alone is it visible
still, and so to its predicted place the observer sets his
circles, and punctual to the prophecy the planet swings
into the field of view. One must be dulled by long
routine to such mastery of mind not to have the act
itself clothe with a sense of charmed withdrawal the
object of his quest.</p>

<p class='c008' >So much and more there are of traveler’s glimpses
by the way, compensation that offsets the frequent discomfort,
and even balking of his purpose by inopportune
cloud. For the best of places is not perfect, and a
storm will sometimes rob him of a region he wished to
see. He must learn to wait upon his opportunities and
then no less to wait for mankind’s acceptance of his
results; for in common with most explorers he will
encounter on his return that final penalty of penetration,
the certainty at first of being disbelieved.</p>

<p class='c008' >In such respect he will be even worse off than were the
other world discoverers of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. For they at least could offer material proof
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
of things that they had seen. Dumb Indians and gold
spoke more convincingly than the lips of the great navigators.
To astronomy, too, that other world was due.
Without a knowledge of the earth’s shape and size got
from Francisco of Pisa, Columbus had never adventured
himself upon the deep. But more than this, an astronomer
it was, in the person of Americus Vespucius,
who first discovered the new world, by recognizing it
as such; Columbus never dreaming he had lighted upon
a world that was new. Nor does it impair one jot or
tittle of his glory that he knew it not. Nothing can
deprive him of the imperishable fame of launching
forth into the void in hope of a beyond, though he
found not what he sought but something stranger still.</p>

<p class='c008' >So, curiously, has it been with the trans-etherian.
To Schiaparelli the republic of science owes a new and
vast domain. His genius first detected those strange
new markings on the Martian disk which have proved
the portal to all that has since been seen, and his courage
in the face of universal condemnation led to exploration
of them. He made there voyage after voyage,
much as Columbus did on Earth, with even less of recognition
from home. As with Columbus, too, the full
import of his great discovery lay hid even to him and
only by discoveries since is gradually resulting in recognition
of another sentient world.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_8_0_8 c015'     >As the character of the travel is distinctive, so the
outcome of the voyage is unique. If he choose his
departure-point aright, the observer will be vouchsafed
an experience without parallel on Earth. To select
this setting-out station is the first step in the journey
upon which everything depends. For it is essential
to visual arrival that a departure-point be taken where
definition is at its best. Now, so far as our present
knowledge goes, the conditions most conducive to
good seeing turn out to lie in one or other of the two
great desert belts that girdle the globe. Many of us
are unaware of the existence of such belts and yet they
are among the most striking features of physical geography.
Could we get off our globe and view it from
without we should mark two sash-like bands of country,
to the poleward side of either tropic, where the surface
itself lay patently exposed. Unclothed of verdure
themselves they would stand forth doubly clear by contrast.
For elsewhere cloud would hide to a greater or
less extent the actual configuration of the Earth’s
topography to an observer scanning it from space.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
One of these sash-like belts of desert runs through
southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, the Sahara,
Arabia Petræa and the Desert of Gobi; the other
traverses Peru, the South African veldt, and Western
Australia. They are desert because in them rain is
rare; and even clouds seldom form. In a twofold
way they conduce to astronomic ends. Absence of
rain makes primarily for clear skies and secondarily
for steady air; and the one of these conditions is no
less vital to sight than the other. Water vapor is a
great upsetter of atmospheric equilibrium and commotion
in the air the spoiler of definition. Thus from
the cloudlessness of their skies man finds in them most
chance of uninterrupted communion with the stars,
while by suitably choosing his spot he here obtains as
well that prime desideratum for planetary work, as
near a heavenly equanimity in the air currents over
his head as is practically possible.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the fact that these regions are desert they are
less frequented of man, and the observer is thus perforce
isolated by the nature of the case, the regions best
adapted to mankind being the least suited to astronomic
observations. In addition to what nature has thus
done in the matter, humanity has further differentiated
the two classes of sights by processes of its own contriving.
Not only is civilized man actively engaged in defacing
such part of the Earth’s surface as he comes in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
contact with, he is equally busy blotting out his sky.
In the latter uncommendable pursuit he has in the last
quarter of a century made surprising progress. With a
success only too undesirable his habitat has gradually
become canopied by a welkin of his own fashioning,
which has rendered it largely unfit for the more delicate
kinds of astronomic work. Smoke from multiplying
factories by rising into the air and forming the nucleus
about which cloud collects has joined with electric
lighting to help put out the stars. These concomitants
of advancing civilization have succeeded above the
dreams of the most earth-centred in shutting off sight
of the beyond so that today few city-bred children
have any conception of the glories of the heavens
which made of the Chaldean shepherds astronomers in
spite of themselves.</p>

<p class='c008' >The old world and the new are alike affected by
such obliteration. Long ago London took the lead
with fogs proverbial wholly due to smoke, fine particles
of solid matter in suspension making these points
of condensation about which water vapor gathers to
form cloud. With the increase of smoke-emitting
chimneys over the world other centres of population
have followed suit till today Europe and eastern North
America vie with each other as to which sky shall be
the most obliterate. Even when the obscuration is not
patent to the layman it is evident to the meteorologist
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
or astronomer. By a certain dimming of the blue,
smoke or dust reveals its presence high up aloft as
telltalely as if the thing itself were visible. Some time
since the writer had occasion to traverse Germany in
summer from Göttingen to Cologne and in so doing was
impressed by a cloudiness of the sky he felt sure had not
existed when he knew it as a boy. For the change
was too startling and extensive to be wholly laid to the
score of the brighter remembrances of youth. On
reaching Cologne he mentioned his suspicion to Klein,
only to find his own inference corroborated; observations
made twenty years ago being impracticable today.
Two years later in Milan Celoria told the same story,
the study of Mars having ceased to be possible there for
like cause. Factory smoke and electric lights had combined
to veil the planet at about the time Schiaparelli
gave up his observations because of failing sight. With
a certain poetic fitness the sky had itself been blotted
just at the time the master’s eye had dimmed.</p>

<p class='c008' >America is not behind in this race for sky extinction.
In the neighborhood of its great cities and spreading into
the country round about the heavens have ceased to be
favorable to research. Not till we pass beyond the
Missouri do the stars shine out as they shone before the
white man came.</p>

<p class='c008' >Few astronomers even fully appreciate how much this
means, so used does man get to slowly changing conditions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
It amounts, indeed, between Washington and
Arizona to a whole magnitude in the stars which may
be seen. At the Naval Observatory of the former
sixty-four stars were mapped in a region where with a
slightly smaller glass one hundred and seventy-two were
charted at Flagstaff.</p>

<p class='c008' >Besides their immediate use as observing stations
these desert belts possess mediate interest on their own
account in a branch of the very study their cloudlessness
helps to promote, the branch here considered, the
study of the planet Mars. They help explain what they
permit to be visible. For in the physical history of the
Earth’s development they are among the latest phenomena
and mark the beginning of that stage of world
evolution into which Mars is already well advanced.
They are symptomatic of the passing of a terraqueous
globe into a purely terrestrial one. Desertism, the state
into which every planetary body must eventually come
and for which, therefore, it becomes necessary to coin a
word, has there made its first appearance upon the
Earth. Standing as it does for the approach of age
in planetary existence, it may be likened to the first
gray hairs in man. Or better still it corresponds to
early autumnal frost in the passage of the seasons.
For the beginning to age in a planet means not decrepitude
in its inhabitants but the very maturing of this
its fruit. Evolution of mind in its denizens continues
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
long after desolation in their habitat has set in.
Indeed, advance in brain-power seriously develops
only when material conditions cease to be bodily propitious
and the loss of corporeal facilities renders its
acquisition necessary to life.</p>

<p class='c008' >The resemblance, distant but distinctive, of the climatic
conditions necessary on earth for the best scanning
of Mars with those which prove to be actually existent
on that other world has a bearing on the subject
worth considerable attention. It helps directly to an
understanding and interpretation of the Martian state
of things. Though partial only, the features and traits
of our arid zones are sufficiently like what prevails on
Mars to make them in some sort exponent of physical
conditions and action there. Much that is hard of
appreciation in a low, humid land shows itself an everyday
possibility in a high and dry one. The terrible
necessity of water to all forms of life, animal or vegetal,
so that in the simple thought of the aborigines rain is
the only god worth great propitiation upon the due
observance of which everything depends, brings to one
a deeper realization of what is really vital and what but
accessory at best. One begins to conceive what must
be the controlling principle of a world where water is
only with difficulty to be had, and rain unknown.</p>

<p class='c008' >But in addition to the fundamental importance of
water, the relative irrelevancy of some other conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
usually deemed indispensable to organic existence
there find illustration too. On the high plateau of
northern Arizona and on the still higher volcanic cones
that rise from them as a base into now disintegrating
peaks, the thin cold air proves no bar to life. To the
fauna there air is a very secondary consideration to
water, and because the latter is scarce in the lowlands
and more abundant higher up, animals ascend after it,
making their home at unusual elevations with no discomfort
to themselves. Deer range to heights where
the barometric pressure is but three fifths that of their
generic habitat. Bear do the like, the brown bear of
northern American sea-level being here met with two
miles above it. Nor is either animal a depauperate
form. Man himself contrives to live in comfort and
propagate his kind where at first he finds it hard to
breathe. Nor are these valiant exceptions; as Merriam
has ably shown in his account of the San Francisco
peak region for the Smithsonian Institution—a most interesting
report, by the way—the other animals are
equally adaptive to the zones of more northern latitudes
on the American continent, zones paralleled in
their flora and fauna by the zones of altitude up this
peak. All which shows that paucity of air is nothing
like the barrier to life we ordinarily suppose and is not
for an instant to be compared with dearth of water.
If in a comparatively short time an animal or plant
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
accustomed to thirty inches of barometric pressure can
contrive to subsist sensibly unchanged at eighteen, it
would be rash to set limits to what time may not do.
And this the more for another instructive fact discovered
in this region by Merriam: that the existence of
a species was determined not by the mean temperature
of its habitat but by the maximum temperature
during the time of procreation. A short warm season
in summer alone decides whether the species shall
survive and flourish; that it has afterward to hibernate
for six months at a time does not in the least
negative the result.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the point of departure should thus prove of
twofold importance, speeding the observer on his
journey and furnishing him with a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vade mecum</span></i> on
arrival, is as curious as opportune. Without such
furtherance, to the bodily eye on the one hand and
the mind’s eye on the other, the voyage were less conclusive
in advent and less satisfactory in attent.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c006'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER III</span><br /> <br />A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF PAST MARTIAN DISCOVERY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >With Mars discovery has from the start waited on
apparent disk. To this end every optical advance
has contributed from the time of Galileo’s opera-glass
to the present day. For apparent distance stands
determined by the size of the eye. But although it
is the telescopic eye that has increased, not the distance
that has diminished, the effect has been kin to being
carried nearer the planet and so to a scanning of its disk
with constantly increasing particularity. Mankind has
to all intents and purposes been journeying Marsward
through the years. Any historic account of the planet,
therefore, becomes a chronicle of seeming bodily approach.</p>

<p class='c008' >Perhaps no vivider way of making this evident and
at the same time no better preface to the present work
could be devised than by putting before the eye in
orderly succession the maps made of Mars by the leading
areographers of their day, since the planet first
began to be charted sixty-five years ago. The procedure
is as much as possible like standing at the telescope
and seeing the phenomena steadily disclose.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
Seen thus in order the facts speak for themselves.
They show that from first to last no doubt concerning
what was seen existed in the minds of those competent
to judge by systematic study of the planet at first hand,
and furthermore, from their mutual corroboration, that
this confidence was well placed. For, far from there
being any conflict of authorities in the case, those entitled
to an opinion in the matter prove singularly at
one.</p>

<p class='c008' >Beginning with Maedler in 1840 the gallery of such
portraitures of the planet comprises those by Kaiser,
Green and Schiaparelli, continued since Schiaparelli’s
time by the earlier ones of the present writer. To
this list has been added one by Flammarion, which
though not solely from his own work gives so just a
representation of what was known at the date, 1876, as
to merit inclusion. The remarkable drawings of Dawes
and the excellent ones of Lockyer in 1862-1864 were
never combined into maps by the observers, and though
the former’s were so synthesized by Proctor in 1867,
the result was conformed to what Proctor thought ought
to be and so is not really a transcript of the drawings
themselves.</p>

<p class='c008' >Each of the maps presented marked in its day the
point areography had reached; and each tells its own
story better than any amount of text. They are
all made upon Mercator’s projection and omit in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
consequence the circumpolar regions. The later ones
give, too, only so much of the surface as was shown at
the opposition they record, for Mars, being tipped now
one way, now another, regards the earth differently according
to its orbital position. In comparing them,
therefore, the equator must be taken for medial line.
Mercator’s projection has been the customary one for
portraying Mars except for such oppositions as chiefly
disclose the arctic pole. And this, too, with a certain
poetic fitness. For it comes by right of priority to
delineation of a new world; seeing that Mercator was
the first to represent in a map the mundane new world
in its entirety, by the rather important addition of
North America to the southern continent already
known, and to give the whole the title America with
‘Ame’ at the top of the map and ‘rica’ at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c008' >In looking at the maps it is to be remembered that
they are what we should call upside down, south standing
at the top and north at the bottom. Inverted they
show because this is the way the telescopic observer always
sees the planet. The disk would seem unnatural
to astronomers were it duly righted. Just the same do
men in the southern hemisphere look at our own Earth
topsy-turvy according to our view, the Sun being to
the north of them and the cold to the south. Certain
landmarks distinguishable in all the maps may serve for
specific introduction. The V-shaped marking on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
equator pointing to the north is the Syrtis Major, the
first marking ever made out upon the planet and drawn
by the great Huyghens in 1659. The isolated oval
patch in latitude 26° south is the Solis Lacus, the pupil
of the eye of Mars; while the forked bay on the
equator, discovered by Dawes, is the Sabaeus Sinus,
the dividing tongue of which, the Fastigium Aryn,
has been taken for the origin of longitudes on Mars.</p>

<p class='c008' >If these maps be carefully compared they will be
found quite remarkably confirmatory each of its predecessor.
To no one will their inter-resemblance seem
more salient than to draughtsmen themselves. For
none know better how surprisingly, even when two
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
men have the same thing under their very noses to copy,
their two versions will differ. Judgment of position
and of relative size is one cause of variation; focusing
of the attention on different details another. What
slight discrepancies affect the maps are traceable to
these two human imperfections. Maps <a href='#i_027fp_2'>IV</a> and <a href='#i_028fp_1'>V</a>
make a case in point: it was to his new-found canals
that Schiaparelli gave heed to the neglect of a due toning
of his map; while Green, less keen-eyed but more
artistic, missed the delicate canaliform detail to make
a speaking portraiture of the whole.</p>

<p class='c008' >Amid the remarkable continuity of progression here
shown, in which each map will be seen to be at once a
review and an advance, we may, nevertheless, distinguish
three stages in the perception of the phenomena.
Thus we may mark:—</p>

<table class='c009' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c017'>I.</td>
    <td class='c011'>A period of recognition of larger markings only;</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c016' >Each period is here represented by four charts; and
each expresses the result of a more minute and intimate
acquaintance with the disk than was possible to the one
that went before. To realize, however, how accurate
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
each was according to his lights it is only necessary
to have the seeing grow steadily better some evening
as one observes. He will find himself recapitulating
in his own person the course taken by discovery for
all those who went before, and in the lapse of an hour
live through the observational experience of sixty
years; in much the same way that the embryological
growth of an individual repeats the development historically
of the race.</p>

<p class='c008' >Two verses of Ovid, which the poet puts into the
mouth of Pythagoras, outline with something like
prophetic utterance the special discoveries which mark
the three periods apart. Ovid makes Pythagoras say
of the then world:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016' >True as the verses are of Earth, the poet could not have
penned them otherwise had he meant to record the
course of astronomic detection on Mars. For they
sound like a presentiment of the facts. A surface
thought at first to be part land, part water; the land
next seen to be seamed with straits; and lastly the sea
made out to be land. Such is the history of the subject,
and words could not have summed it more succinctly.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vidi ego, quod fuerat quondam solidissima
tellus esse fretum</span>” rings like Schiaparelli’s own announcement
of the discovery of the ‘canals.’ Indeed,
I venture to believe he would have made it had he
chanced to recall the verse. So “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vidi factas ex
aequore terras</span>” tells what has since been learned of
the character of the seas.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of the three periods the first was that of the main or
fundamental markings only. It came in with Beer
and Maedler, the inaugurators of areography. That
they planned and executed their survey with but a
four-inch glass shows that there is always room for
genius at the top of any profession and that instruments
are not for everything in its instrumentality. Up to
their day the reality of the planet’s features had been
questioned by some people in spite of having been
certainly seen and drawn by Huyghens and others.
Beer and Maedler’s labors proved them permanent
facts beyond the possibility of dispute.</p>

<p class='c008' >The second period was the period of the discovery of
the now famous canals,—a new era in the study of
Mars opened by Schiaparelli in 1877 (Map <a href='#i_028fp_1'>V</a>). Unsuspicious
of what he was to stumble on, he seized the
then favorable opposition to make, as he put it, a
geodetic survey of the planet’s surface. He hoped this
undertaking feasible to the accuracy of micrometric
measurement. His hopes did not belie him. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
found that it was possible to measure his positions with
sufficient exactness to make a skeleton map on which
to embody the markings in detail—and thus to give
his map vertebrate support. But in the course of his
work he became aware of hitherto unrecognized ligaments
connecting the seas with one another. Instead
of displaying a broad unity of face the bright areas
appeared to be but groundwork for streaks. The
streaks traversed them in all directions, tesselating the
continents into a tilework of islands. Such mosaic was
not only new, but the fashion of the thing was of a
new order or kind. Straits, however, Schiaparelli considered
them and gave them the name <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canali</span></i>, or channels.
How unfamiliar and seemingly impossible the
new detail was is best evidenced by the prompt and
unanimous disbelief with which it was met.</p>

<p class='c008' >Unmoved by the universal scepticism which rewarded
what was to prove an epoch-making discovery, Schiaparelli
went on, in the judgment of his critics, from bad
to worse—for in 1879 (Map <a href='#i_028fp_2'>VI</a>) he took up again his
scrutiny of the planet to the detecting of yet more particularity.
He re-observed most of his old canals and
discovered half as many more; and as his map shows
he perceived an increased regularity in his lines.</p>

<p class='c008' >In 1881-1882 (Map <a href='#i_029fp_1'>VII</a>) he attacked the planet again
and with results yet further out of the common. His
lines were still there with more beside. If they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
looked strange before, they now appeared positively
unnatural. Not content with a regularity which
seemed to the sceptics to preclude their being facts, he
must needs see them now in duplicate. To the eyes of
disbelief this was the crowning stroke of factitiousness.</p>

<p class='c008' >In consequence no end of adverse criticism was
heaped upon his observations by those who could not
see. But curiously enough,—what did not attract
attention,—the blindness of the critics was as much
mental as bodily. For they failed to perceive that
the very unnaturalness which seemed to them to discredit
his observations really proved their genuineness.
His discoveries were so amazing that any change in
strangeness simply went to confirm the universal scepticism
and clouded logic. Yet properly viewed, a
pregnant deduction stands forth quite clearly on a
study of the maps.</p>

<p class='c008' >On comparing maps <a href='#i_028fp_1'>V</a>, <a href='#i_028fp_2'>VI</a> and <a href='#i_029fp_1'>VII</a> an eye duly
directed is struck by a difference in the aspect of the
lines. In his first map the ‘canals’ are depicted simply
as narrow winding streaks, hardly even roughly
regular and by no means such departures from the
plausible as to lie without the communicatory pale.
Indeed, to a modern reader prepared beforehand for
geometric construction they will probably appear no
‘canals’ at all. Certainly the price of acceptance was
not a large one to pay. But like that of the Sibylline
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
Books it increased with putting off. What he offered
the public in 1879 was much more dearly to be bought.
The lines were straighter, narrower, and in every way
less natural than they had seemed two years before.
In 1881-1882 they progressed still more in unaccountability.
They had now become regular rule and compass
lines, as straight, as even, and as precise as any
draughtsman could wish and quite what astronomic
faith did not desire. Having thus donned the character,
they nevermore put it off.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, this curious evolution in depiction points,
rightly viewed, to an absence of design. It shows that
Schiaparelli started with no preconceived idea on the
subject. On the contrary, it is clear that he shared to
begin with the prevailing hesitancy to accept anything
out of the ordinary. Nor did he overcome his reluctance
except as by degrees he was compelled. For the
canals did not change their characteristics from one
opposition to another; the eye it was that learned to
distinguish what it saw, and the brain made better
report as it grew familiar with the messages sent it.
In other words, it is patent from these successive maps
that the geometrical character of the ‘canals’ was
forced upon Schiaparelli by the things themselves,
instead of being, as his critics took for granted, foisted
on them by him. We have since seen the regularity
of the canals so undeniably that we are not now in need
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
of such inferential support to help us to the truth; but
too late, as it is, to be of controversial moment the deduction
is none the less of some corroboratory force.</p>

<p class='c008' >With the third period enters what has been done since
Schiaparelli’s time. For that master was obliged,
from failing sight, to close his work with the opposition
of 1890. In 1892 W. H. Pickering at Arequipa was the
chief observer of the planet and made two important
discoveries: one was the detection of small round spots
scattered over the surface of the planet and connected
with the canal system; the other the perception of
what seemed to him more or less irregular lines traversing
the Mare Erythraeum. Both were notable detections.
The first set of phenomena he called lakes,
the second river-systems, sometimes schematically
‘canals,’ but without committing himself to canaliform
characteristics as his drawings make clear. The same
phenomena were seen at that opposition at the Lick,
by Schaeberle, Barnard and others, and called streaks.
These discoveries took from the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> their supposed
character of seas—a most important event in
knowledge of Mars.</p>

<p class='c021' >The next advance was the detection at Flagstaff
in 1894 of their canaliform characteristics by my then
assistant Mr. Douglass, who in place of the irregular
streaks and river-systems of his predecessors
found the seas to be crossed by lines as regular and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
as regularly connected as the canals in the light
regions. To him they appeared broad and ill
defined, but so habitually did to him the canals in the
light areas, while for directness and uniformity the one
set showed as geometrically perfect as the other. All
the dark <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> of the southern hemisphere he found to
be laced with them and that they formed a network
over the dark regions, counterparting that over the
light. Still more significant was the fact that their
points of departure coincided with the points of arrival
of the bright-region canals, so that the two connected
to form in its entirety a single system. After the publication
of his results (Lowell Observatory Annals,
Volume I, 1895) Schiaparelli identified some of those
in the Syrtis with what he had himself seen there in
1888 (<cite>Memoria</cite>, VI, 1899), though his own had not been
sufficiently well seen of him to impress him as canals.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of other additions to our knowledge since made by
the writer the present book treats; as also of the
theory they originally suggested to him and which his
later observations have only gone to confirm.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c015'     >Almost as soon as magnification gives Mars a
disk that disk shows markings, white spots crowning
a globe spread with blue-green patches on an orange
ground. The smallest telescope is capable of this far-off
revelation; while with increased power the picture
grows steadily more articulate and full. With a two
and a quarter inch glass the writer saw them thirty-five
years ago.</p>

<p class='c008' >After the assurance that markings exist the next
thing to arrest attention is that these markings move.
The patches of color first made out by the observer are
shortly found by him to have shifted in place upon the
planet. And this not through mistake on his part but
through method in the phenomena; for all do it alike.
In orderly rotation the features make their appearance
upon the body’s righthand limb (in the telescopic
image), travel across the central meridian of the disk
and vanish over its lefthand border. One follows another,
each rising, culminating and setting in its turn
under the observer’s gaze. A constantly progressing
panorama passes majestically before his sight, new
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
objects replacing the old with a march so steady and
withal so swift that a few minutes will suffice to mark
unmistakably the fact of such procession. But for
all this ceaseless turning under his gaze, after a certain
lapse of time it is evident that the same features are
being shown him over again. With such recognition
of recurrence comes the first advance toward acquaintance
with the Martian world. For that in all their
journeying their configuration alters not, proves them
permanent in place, part and parcel of the solid surface
of that other globe. This surface, then, lies exposed
to view and by its turning shows itself subject, like
our earth, to the vicissitudes of day and night.</p>

<p class='c008' >In such self-exposure Mars differs from all the four
great planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
Features, indeed, are apparent on the first two of these
globes and dimly on the other two as well, but they lack
the stability of the Martian markings. They are forever
exchanging place. In the case of Jupiter what we see is
undoubtedly a cloud-envelop through which occasional
glimpses may possibly be caught of a chaotic nucleus
below. With Saturn it is the same; and the evidence
is that the like is true of Uranus and Neptune. What
goes on under their great cloud canopies we can only surmise.
With Mars, however, we are not left to imagination
in the matter but so far as our means permit can
actually observe what there takes place. Except for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
distance, which, through science, year by year grows
less, it is as if we hovered above the planet in a balloon,
with its various features spread out to our gaze
below.</p>

<p class='c008' >Attention shows these areographic features to be on
hand with punctual precision for their traverse of the
disk once every twenty-four hours and thirty-seven
minutes. For over two hundred years this has been
the case, their untiring revolutions having been watched
so well that we know the time they take to the nicety
of a couple of hundredths of a second. We thus become
possessed of a knowledge of the length of the Martian
day and it is not a little interesting to find that it very
closely counterparts in duration our own, being only
one thirty-fifth the longer of the two. We also find
from the course the markings pursue the axis about
which they turn; and just as the period of the rotation
tells us the length of the Martian day so the tilt of the
axis, taken in connection with the form of the orbit,
determines the character of the Martian seasons. Here
again we confront a curious resemblance in the circumstances
of the two planets, for the tilt of the equator
to the plane of the orbit is with Mars almost precisely
what it is for the Earth. The more carefully the two are
measured the closer the similitude becomes. Sir William
Herschel made the Martian 28°, Schiaparelli reduced
this to 25°, and later determination by the writer
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
puts it nearer 24°. The latter is the one now adopted
in the British Nautical Almanac for observers of
the planet. This is a very close parallelism indeed;
so that in general character the Martian seasons
are nearly the counterpart of ours. In length, however,
they differ; first because the year of Mars is
almost double the length of the terrestrial one and
secondly because from the greater ellipticity of Mars’
orbit the seasons are more unequal than is the case with
us, some being run through with great haste, others
being lingered on a disproportionate time. It is usual
on the Earth to consider spring as the period from the
vernal equinox, about March 21, to the summer solstice,
about June 20; summer as lasting thence to the autumnal
equinox; autumn from this latter date, about
September 20, to the winter solstice on December 21;
and winter from that point on to the next spring
equinox again. On this division our seasons in the
northern hemisphere last respectively: spring, 91 days;
summer, 92 days; autumn, 92 days; and winter, 90
days. On Mars these become, reckoned in our days:
spring, 199 days; summer 183 days; autumn, 147
days; and winter, 158 days. If we had counted them
in Martian days they would have totaled about one
thirty-fifth less in number each.</p>

<p class='c008' >In its days and seasons, then, Mars is wonderfully
like the Earth; except for the length of the year we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
should hardly know the difference in reckoning of time
could we some morning wake up there instead of here.
Only in one really unimportant respect should we feel
strange; in months we should find ourselves turned
topsy-turvy. But lunations have nothing to do with
climate nor with the alternation between night and
day; and in these two important respects we should
certainly feel at home.</p>

<p class='c008' >Though the axis could be determined by the daily
march of any marking and thus the planet’s tropic,
temperate and polar regions marked out, the process
is made easier by the presence of white patches covering
the planet’s poles and known, in consequence,
as the polar caps. It is from measures of the patches
that the position of the Martian poles has actually
been determined. These polar caps are exactly analogous
in general position to those which bonnet our own
Earth. They reproduce the appearance of the ice and
snow of our arctic and antarctic regions seen from space,
in a very remarkable manner. In truth they are things
of note in more ways than one and would claim precedence
on many counts. Priority of recognition, however,
alone entitles them to premier consideration.
Among the very first of the disk’s detail to be made
out by man, they justly demand description first.</p>

<p class='c008' >With peculiar propriety the polar caps have thus
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pas</span></i>. Not only do they stand first in order of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
visibility, but they prove to occupy a like position
logically when it comes to an explanation of the
planet’s present physical state. It is not matter of
hazard that the most evident of all the planet’s markings
should also be the most fundamental, the fountainhead
from which everything else flows. It is of the
essence of the planet’s condition and furnishes the key
to its comprehension. The steps leading to this conclusion
are as interesting as they are cogent. They
start at the polar caps’ visibility. For their size first
riveted man’s attention and then attention to them
disclosed that most vital of the characteristics of the
planet’s surface: change.</p>

<p class='c008' >Just as almost all of the features we note are permanent
in place, showing that they belong to the surface,
so are they all impermanent in character. Change
is the only absolutely unchanging thing except position
about the features the planet presents to view. It
was in the aspect of the polar caps that this important
fact first came to light. Not only did they thus initially
instance a general law, they have turned out to make
it; for by themselves changing they largely cause
change in all the rest. But for a long time they alone
exemplified its workings. To Sir William Herschel
we owe the first study of their change in aspect. This
eminent observer noted that their varying size was
subject to a regular rhythmic wax and wane timed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
the course of the seasons of the planet’s year. The
caps increased in the winter of their hemisphere and
decreased in its summer and being situate in opposite
hemispheres they did this alternately with pendulum-like
precision. His observations were soon abundantly
confirmed, for the phenomena take place upon a vast
scale and are thus easy of recognition. At their maximum
spread the caps cover more than one hundred times
as much ground as when they have shrunk to their
minimum. In the depth of winter they stretch over
much more than the polar zone, coming down to 60°
and even 50° of latitude north or south as the case may
be, thence melting till by midsummer they span only
five or six degrees across.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this they bear close analogue to the behavior
of our own. Ours would show not otherwise were they
viewed from the impersonal standpoint of space. Very
little telescopic aid suffices to disclose the Martian polar
phenomena in this their more salient characteristics
and convince an observer of their likeness to those of the
earth. Any one may note what is there going on by
successive observations of the planet with a three-inch
glass. Nor is the change by any means slow. A few
days at the proper Martian season, or at most a couple
of weeks, produces conspicuous and conclusive alterations
in the size of these nightcaps of the planet’s
winter sleep. Resembling our own so well they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
early surmised to be of like constitution and composed,
therefore, of ice and snow. Plausible on its face, this
view of them was generally adopted and common sense
has held to it ever since. It has encountered, of course,
opposition, partly from very proper conservatism,
but chiefly from that earth-centred philosophy which
has doubted most advances since Galileo’s time, and
carbonic acid has been put forward by this school of
sceptics to take its place. We shall critically examine
both objections; the latter first, because a certain
physical fact enables us to dispose of it at once. In
casual appearance there is not much to choose between
the rival candidates of common sense and uncommon
subtlety, water and frozen carbonic acid gas, both being
suitably white and both going and coming with the
temperature. But, upon closer study, in one point of
behavior the two substances act quite unlike, and had
half the ingenuity been expended in testing the theory
as in broaching it this fact had come to light to the
suggestors as it did upon examination to the writer
and had served as a touchstone in the case. At pressures
of anything like one atmosphere or less carbonic
acid passes at once from the solid to the gaseous state.
Water, on the other hand, lingers in the intermediate
stage of a liquid. Now, as the Martian cap melts it
shows surrounded by a deep blue band which accompanies
it in its retreat, shrinking to keep pace with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
shrinkage in the cap. This is clearly the product of the
disintegration since it waits so studiously upon it. The
substance composing the cap, then, does not pass instantaneously
or anything like it from the solid to the
gaseous condition.</p>

<p class='c008' >This badge of blue ribbon about the melting cap,
therefore, conclusively shows that carbonic acid is
not what we see and leaves us with the only alternative
we know of: water.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c015'     >Assured by physical properties that our visual
appearances are quite capable of being what they
seem we pass to the phenomena of the cap itself. Like
as are the polar caps of the two planets at first regard,
upon further study very notable differences soon disclose
themselves between the earthly and the Martian
ones; and these serve to give us our initial hint of a
different state of things over there from that with
which we are conversant on Earth.</p>

<p class='c008' >To begin with, the limits between which they fluctuate
are out of all proportion greater on Mars. It is
not so much in their maxima that the ice-sheets of the
two planets vary. Our own polar caps are much
larger than we think; indeed, we live in them a good
fraction of the time. Our winter snows are in truth
nothing but part and parcel of the polar cap at that
season. Now, in the northern hemisphere snow covers
the ground at sea-level more or less continuously down
to 50° of latitude. It stretches thus far even on the
western flanks of the continents, while in the middle of
them and on their eastern sides it extends ten degrees
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
farther yet during the depth of winter. So that we
have a polar cap which is then ninety degrees across.
In our southern hemisphere it is much the same six
months later, in the corresponding winter of its year.</p>

<p class='c008' >On Mars at their winter maxima the polar caps extend
over a similar stretch of latitude. They do so, however,
unequally. The southern one is considerably the
larger. In 1903, 136 days after the winter solstice,
in the Martian calendar February 27, it came down in
longitude 225° to 44° of latitude and may be taken to
have then measured ninety-three degrees across; in
1905, 121 days after the same solstice, it stretched
in longitude 235° to latitude 42°, and 158 days later,
in longitude 221° to latitude 41°; values which, supposing
it to have been round, imply for it a diameter
on these occasions of ninety-six and ninety-seven
degrees. It was then February 20 and March 10
respectively of the Martian year. These determinations
of its size at the two oppositions agree sufficiently well
considering the great tilt away from us of the south
pole at the time and the horizonward foreshortening
of the edge of the snow. It seems from a consensus
of the measures to have been some five degrees
wider in 1903 than in 1905, which may mean a colder
winter preceding the former date. The cap was still
apparently without a dark contour in both years,
showing that it had not yet begun to melt.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
Less has been learnt of the northern cap. In 1896-1897
when it was similarly presented skirting the other
rim of the disk, a gap occurred in the observations corresponding
to the time by Martian months between February
24 and March 22. On the former date the cap
came down only to latitude 55° in longitude 352°;
on the subsequent one and for several days after the
latitude of the southern limit of the snow was such as
to imply a breadth to it of about eighty degrees. The
cap was now bordered by a dark line, proving that melting
had already set in. It cannot, however, at its
maximum have covered much more country than this,
in view of its lesser extent on February 24.</p>

<p class='c008' >Fair as our knowledge now is of the dimensions of the
Martian polar caps at their maxima, we have much
more accurate information with regard to their minima,
and this, too, was obtained much earlier. That we
should first have known their smallest rather than their
greatest extent with accuracy may appear surprising,
exactly the opposite being our knowledge of our own.
It is not, however, so surprising as it appears, inasmuch
as it is an inevitable consequence of the planet’s
aspect with regard to the sun. When the tilt of the
axis inclines one hemisphere toward the sun, that hemisphere’s
polar cap must melt and dwindle, while at
the same time it is the one best seen, the other being
turned away from the sun and therefore largely
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
from us as well; so that even such part of the latter
as is illumined lies low down toward the horizon of
the disk where a slight change of angle means a
great difference in size.</p>

<p class='c008' >It has thus come about that both the south and the
north polar caps have been repeatedly well seen and
measured at their minimum; and the measures for
different Martian years agree well with one another.
For the northern cap six degrees in diameter is about
the least value to which it shrinks. The south one
becomes even smaller, being usually not more than five
degrees across, while in 1894 it actually vanished, a
thing unprecedented. Its absence was detected by
Douglass at Flagstaff and shortly after the announcement
of its disappearance the fact was corroborated
by Barnard at the Lick. The position the cap would
have occupied was at the time better placed for observation
in America than in Europe, inasmuch as the
cap is eccentrically situated with regard to the geographic
pole and its centre was then well on the side
of the disk presented to us while in Europe it was turned
away. This, together with the fact that it undoubtedly
came and went more than once about this time, accounts
for its disappearance not having been recognized
there, haze left by it having apparently been
mistaken for the cap itself.</p>

<p>North Polar Cap.<br />(Lowell Observatory, 1905.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >On Earth the minima are much larger. In the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
northern hemisphere the line of perpetual snow or
pack-ice in longitude 50° east runs about on the 80°
parallel, including within it the southern end of Franz
Joseph Land. Opposite this, in longitude 120° west,
above the North American continent, it reaches down
lower still to 75°. So that the cap is then from twenty
to thirty degrees in diameter. In the southern hemisphere
it is even larger. In longitude 170° west the
land was found by Ross to be under perpetual snow in
latitude 72°. Cook had reached in longitude 107°
east an impassable barrier of ice in latitude 70° 23′.
The season was then midsummer, January 30. So that
we are perhaps justified in considering 71° south as
about the average limit of perpetual snow or paleocrystic
ice. This would make the southern cap at its
minimum thirty-eight degrees across. Pack-ice with
open spots extends still farther north. The Pagoda in
1845 was stopped by impenetrable pack-ice in south
latitude 68° and the Challenger in 1874 encountered
the pack in latitude 65° on the 19th of February, which
corresponds about to our 19th of August, the time at
which the sea should be most open. The limit of perpetual
snow is thus lower in the southern than in the
northern hemisphere. Here again, then, the two
minima differ, but in the reverse way from what they
do on Mars.</p>

<p class='c008' >From this we perceive that the variations in size of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
the caps are much more striking on Mars than on the
Earth and that these are due chiefly to the difference in
the minima, the maxima not varying greatly.</p>

<p class='c008' >To explain these interesting diversities of behavior
in the several polar caps we shall have to go back a
little in general physics in order to get a proper take
off. It is a curious concomitant of the law of gravity
that the amount of heat received by a planet in passing
from any point of its path to a point diametrically
opposite is always the same no matter what be the
eccentricity of the orbit. Thus, a planet has as many
calories falling upon it in travelling from its vernal
equinox to its autumnal as from the autumnal to the
vernal again, although the time taken in the one journey
be very different from that of the other. This is due
to the fact that the angle swept over by the radius vector,
that is, the imaginary bond between it and the sun,
is at all points proportional to the amount of heat received;
just as it is of the gravity undergone, the two
forces radiating into space as the inverse square of the
distance. Thus the heat received by a point or a
hemisphere, through any orbital angle, is independent
of the eccentricity of the orbit.</p>

<p class='c008' >But it is not independent of the axial tilt. For the
force of the sun’s rays is modified by their obliquity.
The amount of heat received at any point in consequence
of the tilt turns upon the position of the point, and for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
any hemisphere taken as a whole it depends upon the
degree to which the pole is tilted to the source of heat.
In consequence of being more squarely presented to its
beams, the hemisphere which is directed toward the
sun and therefore is passing through its summer season
gets far more insolation than that which is at the same
time in the depth of its winter. For a tilt of twenty-four
degrees, the present received value for the axis
of Mars, the two hemispheres so circumstanced get
amounts of heat respectively in the proportion of
sixty-three to thirty-seven.</p>

<p class='c008' >But, though the summer and winter insolation thus
differ, they are the same for each hemisphere in turn.
Consequently the mere amount of heat received cannot
be the cause of any differences detected between the
respective maxima and minima of the two polar
caps. If heat were a substance which could be stored
up instead of being a mode of motion, the effect produced
would be in accordance with the quantity applied
and the two caps would behave alike. As it is
the total amount has very little to say in the matter.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not the amount of heat but the manner in which this
heat is made at home is responsible for the difference
we observe. Now, though the total amount is the
same in passing from the vernal to the autumnal equinox
as from the autumnal to the vernal, the time during
which it is received in either case varies from one hemisphere
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
to the other. It is summer in the former while
it is winter in the latter and the difference in the length
of the two seasons due to the eccentricity of the orbit
makes a vast difference in the result. Winter affects
the maxima, summer the minima, attained. Of these
opposite variations presented to us by the two caps,
the maxima, the one most difficult to detect, is the
easiest to explain, for the difference in the maxima
seems to be due to the surpassing length of the antarctic
night.</p>

<p class='c008' >Owing to the eccentricity of the orbital ellipse pursued
by Mars and to the present position of the planet’s
solstices, the southern hemisphere is farther away from
the sun during its winter and is so for a longer time.
The seasons are in length, for the northern hemisphere:
spring, 199 days; summer, 183 days; autumn, 147
days; and winter, 158 days; while for the southern
hemisphere they are: spring, 147 days; summer, 158
days; autumn, 199 days; and winter, 183 days. The
arctic polar night is thus 305 of our days long; the
antarctic, 382. Thus for 77 more days than happens to
its fellow the southern pole never sees the sun. Now,
since the total sunlight from equinox to equinox is the
same in both hemispheres, its distribution by days must
be different. In the southern hemisphere the same
amount is crowded into a smaller compass in the
proportion of 305 to 382; that being that hemisphere’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
relative ratio of days. But since during winter the cap
increases, there is a daily excess of accumulation over
dissipation of snow and each twenty-four hours must
on the average add its tithe to the sum total. Since the
northern days are the warmer each adds less than do
the southern ones; and furthermore there are fewer of
them. On both these scores the amount of the deposition
about the northern pole should be less than
about the southern one. Consequently, the snow-sheet
there should be the less extensive and show a
relatively smaller maximum, which explains what we
see.</p>

<p class='c008' >With the minima the action is otherwise. Inasmuch
as the greater heat received during the daylight hours
by the southern hemisphere is exactly offset by the
shortness of its season, it would seem at first as if there
could be no difference in the total effect upon the two
ice-caps.</p>

<p class='c008' >But further consideration discloses a couple of factors
which might, and possibly do, come in to qualify the
action and account for the observed effect. One is that
though the total amount of heat received is the same,
the manner of its distribution differs in the two hemispheres.
In the northern one the time from vernal
to autumnal equinox is 382 days against 305 in the
southern. Consequently, the average daily heat is
then five fourths more intense in the southern hemisphere.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
Indeed, it is even greater than this and nearer
four thirds, because the melting occurs chiefly in the
spring and in the first two months of summer when the
contrast in length of season between the two hemispheres
is at its greatest. Now, a few hotter days
might well work more result than many colder ones.
And this would be particularly true of Mars where the
mean temperature is probably none too much above the
freezing-point to start with. Ice consumes so much
caloric in the process of turning into any other state,
laying it by in the form of latent heat before it can
turn into water and then so much more before this
water can be converted into steam that a good deal has
to be expended on it before getting any perceptible
result. Once obtained, however, the heat is retained
with like tenacity. So that the process works to
double effect! If sufficient heat be received the ice is
first melted, then evaporated and finally formed into
a layer of humid air, the humidity of which keeps it
warm. Dry air is unretentive of heat, moist air the
opposite. And for the melting of the ice-cap to proceed
most effectively the temperature that laps it about
must be as high as possible and kept so as continuously
as may be. If between days it be allowed to fall too
low at night much caloric must needs be wasted in
simply raising the ice again to the melting-point. This
a blanket of warm air tends to prevent, and this again
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
is brought about by a few hot days rather than by
many colder ones. It is not all the heat received that
becomes effective but the surplus heat above a certain
point. The gain in continuity of action thus brought
about is somewhat like that exhibited between the
running of an express and an accommodation train.
To reach its destination in a given time the former
requires far less power because it does not have to get
up speed again after each arrest. Thus the whole effect
in melting the snow would be greater upon that hemisphere
whose summer happens to be the more intense.</p>

<p class='c008' >The greater swing in size of the cap most exposed to
the effects of the eccentricity is, then, the necessary
result of circumstances when the precipitation is not
too great to be nearly carried off by the subsequent
dissipation. This is the state of things on Mars and
the second of the factors above referred to. On the
Earth as we have seen the polar caps are somewhat
larger at their maximum and very much so at their
minimum. Now, this is just what should happen
were the precipitation increased. Suppose, for example,
that the amount of precipitation were to increase
while the amount of summer melting remained the
same, and this would be the case if the vapor in the air
augmented for one cause or another, and the result
of each fresh deposit was locked up in snow. After
a certain point the cap would grow in depth rather than
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
in extension; the winter deposit would be thicker
but the summer evaporation would remain the same.
Now, if this occurred, it is evident that the minimum
size of the cap would increase relatively much faster
than the maximum, and furthermore, that the relative
increase of the minimum in the two caps would be
greatest for that which had seasons of extremes.
The result we see in the case of the Earth. In the arctic
cap, where in consequence of the eccentricity of the
orbit the winter is shorter, the maximum is less than
in the antarctic and this extra amount of precipitation
cannot be wholly done away with in its intenser summer,
so that the minimum too is greater there.</p>

<p class='c008' >We reach, then, this interesting conclusion. We find
that eccentricity of orbit by itself not only causes no
universal glaciation in the hemisphere which we should
incidentally suppose likely to show it, but actually
produces the opposite result, in more than offsetting by
summer proximity what winter distance brings about.
To cause extensive glaciation we must have, in addition
to favorable eccentricity, a large precipitation.
With these two factors combined we get an ice age, but
not otherwise. The result has an important bearing
on geologic glacial periods and their explanation.</p>

<p class='c008' >Once formed, an ice-sheet cools everything about it
and chills the climate of its hemisphere. It is a perpetual
storehouse of cold. Mars has no such general
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
glaciation in either hemisphere, and the absence of it,
which is due to lesser precipitation, together with the
clearness of its skies, accounts for the warmth which
the surface exhibits and which has been found so hard
hitherto to interpret. Could our earth but get rid of
its oceans, we too might have temperate regions
stretching to the poles.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Polar expeditions exert an extreme attraction on
certain minds, perhaps because they combine the
maximum of hardship with the minimum of headway.
Inconclusiveness certainly enables them to be
constantly renewed, without loss either of purpose or
prestige. The fact that the pole has never been trod
by man constitutes the lodestone to such undertakings;
and that it continues to defy him only whets his endeavor
the more. Except for the demonstration of the
polar drift-current conceived of and then verified by
Nansen, very little has been added by them to our
knowledge of the globe. Nor is there specific reason to
suppose that what they might add would be particularly
vital. Nothing out of the way is suspected of the pole
beyond the simple fact of being so positioned. Yet
for their patent inconclusion they continue to be sent
in sublime superiority to failure.</p>

<p class='c008' >Martian polar expeditions, as undertaken by the
astronomer, are the antipodes of these pleasingly perilous
excursions in three important regards, which if
less appealing to the gallery commend themselves to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
philosopher. They involve comparatively little hardship;
they have accomplished what they set out to do;
and the knowledge they have gleaned has proved fundamental
to an understanding of the present physical
condition of the planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >The antithesis in pole-pursuing between the two
planets manifests itself at the threshold of the inquiry,
in the relative feasibility with which the phenomena
on Mars may be scanned. For, curiously enough, instead
of being the pole and its surrounding paleocrystic
ice which remains hidden on Mars, it is rather the
extreme extent of its extension and the lowest latitudinal
deposit of frost which lies shrouded in mystery.
The difficulty there is not to see the pole but to see in
winter the regions from which our own expeditions set
out. And this because the poles are well displayed
to us at times which are neither few nor very far between;
while favorable occasions for marking the edge
of the caps when at their greatest have neither proved
so numerous nor so favorable. The tilt of the planet’s
axis when conveniently placed for human observation
has been the cause of the one drawback; the planet’s
meteorological condition in those latitudes at that
season the reason for the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >What knowledge we have of the size of the caps in
degrees upon the surface of the planet at this their
extreme equatorward extension has been given in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
last chapter. Their aspect at the time together with
what that aspect betokens was not there touched upon.
With it, therefore, and the peculiarities it presents to
view we shall begin our account of the caps’ annual
history.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>South Polar Cap in winter.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >When first the hemisphere, the pole of which has for
half a Martian year been turned away from the sun,
begins to emerge from its long hibernation, the snow-cap
which covers it down even to temperate regions
presents an undelimited expanse of white, the edges
of which merge indistinguishably into the groundwork
color of the regions round about. Of a dull opaque
hue along its border, its contour is not sharp but fades
off in a fleecy fringe without hard and fast line of demarcation.
Such notably was the aspect of the north
temperate zone in 1896 when, tilted as it then was away
from us into a mere northern
horizon of the planet’s limb,
it showed prior to the definite
recognition of the north polar
cap in August of that year,
and such too was the look of
the disk’s southern edge both
before and after the first certain
detection of the southern
cap in 1903 and 1905. Each was then in the depth
of winter. For in Martian chronology the season corresponded
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
in each at the time to what we know in our
northern hemisphere as the latter part of February
and the early part of March and the appearance of the
planet’s surface in both was not unlike what we know
at the same season in latitude 45°. Indeed, there is
reason to suppose bad weather there then and the
extreme fringe, from the pale tint it exhibited, to have
been cloud rather than snow.</p>

<p class='c008' >It is quite in keeping with what we know on earth
or can conceive of elsewhere that such aspect should
characterize the cap at or near the attainment of its
greatest development. Whether it were not yet quite
arrived at this turning-point of its career or had but
slightly passed it a vagueness of outline would in either
event proclaim the fact. For were the frost still depositing,
the cap’s edge would show indefinite; and on
the other hand had it just begun to melt, evaporation
would give it an undefined edge before the melting
water had gathered in sufficient quantities to be itself
noticeable.</p>

<p class='c008' >Its behavior subsequent to recognition bore out the
inference from its aspect when it first appeared. While
for many days prior to its coming unmistakably into
view it was impossible to say whether what was seen
of the southern cap in 1903 and 1905 was cloud or
snow; so even after it had definitely disclosed itself it
continued to play at odds with the observer. Showing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
sharp at the edges one day it would appear but hazily
defined the next, thus clearly demonstrating itself to be
at the then unstable acme of its spread. Such a state
of things we are only too familiar with in our own
March weather when after days of sunshine that have
melted off the winter’s white and fringed it with rivulets
and awakening grass, a snow-storm falling upon it powders
the ground again that was beginning to be bare
and at one stroke extends the domain of the snow while
mystifying the actual limits it may be said to occupy.
The same condition of things, then, is not unknown on
Mars, and to fix the precise date of so wavering a phenomenon
is not so much matter of difficult observation
as of physical impossibility.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Hellas in winter.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Nor is the southern cap, at this the height of its
winter expansion, confined strictly to its own proper
limits. Faint extensions, now so connected with its
main body as to form part and parcel of it, now so detached
and dull of tint as to make the observer doubtful
of the exact relationship, are generally to be seen
attendant on it. Hellas in winter is much given to such
questionable garb, and has in consequence been mistaken
by more than one observer for the cap itself,
appearing as it does well upon the southern limb and
being often the only region to show white. Indeed,
frost-bound as it then is, to consider it the polar cap,
though possibly geographically incorrect, may climatologically
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
be sustainable. Its northern extremity
extends down to latitude 30°, a pretty low
latitude
for frost. Still such equatorward
extension is not without
corroborating parallel.
In 1903, at what was in
Martian dates April 26, the
whole of the region south of
the Solis Lacus and the
Nectar showed white, with a
whiteness which may as well
have been hoarfrost as cloud. Now, the Nectar runs
east and west in latitude 28°. So that in this instance,
too, it is possible that
arctic conditions knocked at
the very doors of the tropics.
Encroachment of the sort is
equivalent to snow in Cairo
and permanent snow at that;
not an occasional snow flurry,
but something to linger on
the ground and stay visible
sixty millions of miles away.</p>

<p class='c008' >Knowledge of either cap in this the midwinter of its
year has been a matter of the most recent oppositions
of the planet. Up to within the last few years our
acquaintance with either cap was chiefly confined to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
months,—one might almost say the weeks,—immediately
surrounding the summer solstice of its respective
hemisphere. The behavior of the caps during the
rest of their career was largely unknown to us, from
the very disadvantageous positions they occupied at the
times the planet was nearest to the earth. Beginning
with 1894, however, our knowledge of both has been
much extended, by a proportionate extension of the
period covered by the observations. It used to be
thought impracticable to observe the planet far on
either side of opposition; now it is observed from as
much as four months before that event to the same
period after it. The result is a systematic series of observations
which in many ways has given unexpected
insight into Martian conditions. One of the benefits
secured has been the lengthening of the period of study
of the cap’s career, a pushing of inquiry farther back
into its spring history and a longer lingering with it
in its autumnal rebuilding. Yet up to the very last
opposition a gap in its chronology still remained between
February 25 and April 1. The opposition of
1905 has bridged this hiatus and brought us down to
the latter date, at which the melting of the cap begins
in earnest.</p>

<p class='c008' >From this point, April 1 on, we have abundant evidence
of the cap’s behavior. Its career now for some
time is one long chronicle of contraction. Like Balzac’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Peau de Chagrin</span></i> it simply shrinks, giving out of its
virtue in the process. The cap proceeds to dwindle
almost under the observer’s eye till, from an enormous
white counterpane spread over all the polar and
a large part of the temperate zone, its area contracts
to but the veriest nightcap of what it was before.
From seventy degrees across it becomes sixty, then
fifty, then forty, till by the middle of the Martian
May it has become not more than thirty degrees in
diameter. During this time, from the moment the
melting began in good earnest, the retreating white
is girdled by a dark band, of a blue tint, which
keeps pace with the edge of the cap, shrinking as it
shrinks, and diminishing in width as the volume of
the melting decreases.</p>

<p class='c008' >After the melting has been for some time under way
and the cap has become permanently bordered by its
dark blue band a peculiar phenomenon makes its
appearance in the cap itself. This is its fission into one
or more parts. The process begins by the appearance
of dark rifts which, starting in from the cap’s exterior,
penetrate into its heart until at last they cleave it in
two. Rifts have been seen by several observers and in
both caps; and what is most suggestive they always
appear in the same places, year after year. Sometimes
oppositions elapse between their several detections
for they are not the least difficult of detail; but when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
they are caught, they prove to lie just where they did
before.</p>

<p class='c008' >The permanency in place of the rifts, a characteristic
true of them all, shows them to be of local habit. Thus
the rift of 1884 and 1897 reappeared again to another
observer in the same position in 1901. They are, therefore,
features of, or directly dependent on, the surface
of the planet. But it will not do from this fact to infer
that they are expressive of depressions there. The
evidence is conclusive that great irregularities of surface
do not exist on Mars. As we shall see when we
come to consider the orology of the planet it is certain
that elevations there of over two or three thousand feet
in altitude are absent. Differences of temperature, able
to explain a melting of the ice in one locality coincidentally
with its retention in an adjacent one, must in
consequence be unknown. And this much more conclusively
than at first appears, for the reason that the
smaller the planet’s mass the less rapidly does its
blanket of air thin out in ascent above the surface.
This is in consequence of the greater pull the larger
body exerts and the greater density it imparts to a compressible
gas like our atmosphere. Gravity acts like
any force producing pressure and by it the envelope of
air is squeezed into a smaller compass. But as this is
done throughout the atmospheric layer it means a
more rapid rarefaction as one leaves the body. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>63</a></span>
action is such that the height necessary to reach an
analogic density varies inversely as the gravity of the
mass. In consequence of this, to compass a relative
thermometric fall for which a moderate difference
of elevation would suffice on Earth, an immoderate
one must be made on Mars. For gravity there being
but three eighths what it is here, eight thirds the rise
must be made to attain a proportionate lowering of
temperature. This fact renders the above argument
against elevation and depression being the cause of
the phenomenon three times as cogent as it otherwise
would be.</p>

<p class='c008' >With so gradual a gradient in barometric pressure
there and so low a set of contour lines, altitude must be
a negligible factor in Martian surface meteorologic
phenomena. Both density and temperature can be but
little affected by such cause, and we must search elsewhere
for explanation of what surface peculiarities
we detect.</p>

<p class='c008' >Meanwhile the rifts themselves, from being lines
which penetrate the cap from its periphery in toward
its centre, end by traversing it in its entirety and separating
portions which, becoming outlying subsidiary
patches, themselves proceed to dwindle and eventually
disappear. The rifts usually take their rise from such
broader parts of the cap-encircling blue belt as make
beads upon that cordon and are clearly spots where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>64</a></span>
product of the melting of the cap is either specially
collected, or produces its most visible effect.</p>

<p class='c008' >So far the description might apply with substantial
accuracy to either cap. Yet the conduct of the two is
in some ways diverse and begins to accentuate itself
from this point on.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Northern Cap hooded with vapor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >From the time that the north polar cap reaches a
diameter of about twenty-five degrees, a singular change
steals over it. From having been up to then of a well-defined
outline it now proceeds to grow hazy and
indistinct all along its edge. This change in its character
at the same period of its career has been quite
noticeable at each of the three last oppositions, so that
small doubt remains that the
metamorphosis is a regularly
recurrent one in the history
of the cap. Coincident with
the obliteration of its contour,
its dimensions seemingly
enlarge. It is as if a
hood had been drawn over
the cap of a dull white different
from the dazzling brilliance of the cap itself
and covering more ground. Such is probably what
occurs; with vapor for veil. The excessive melting of
the cap produces an extensive evaporation which then
in part condenses to be deposited afresh, in part remains
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
as a covering, shutting off from our view the
outlines of the cap itself. It would seem that at this
time the cap melts faster than the air can carry it
off. A sort of steaming appears to be going on, taking
place <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i>. For it clearly is not wafted away.
The time of its coming too is significant. For the
season is May 15, the height of time for a spring haze
to set in. Then later it dissipates with the same quiet
indefiniteness with which it gathered.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Northern Cap unmasked.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >It is some time in Martian June before the spring
haze clears away, and when it does go, only a tiny
polar cap stands revealed beneath
it, from six to eight
degrees across, or from a
tenth to a fifteenth of what
it was when it passed into
its curious spring chrysalis.
The date of emergence varies.
In 1903 it occurred
early, the haze not being
marked after June 3, though recurring again at intervals
for a day or so. In 1905 it was later; perceptibly
thin after June 21 it did not certainly clear
away till June 9 and came back again on July 16 and
possibly on the 25th.</p>

<p class='c008' >These vicissitudes of aspect give us glimpses into a
sweet unreasonableness in Martian weather which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
makes it seem more akin to our own. And this on two
counts, diurnal and annual. From day to day atmospheric
conditions shift for purely local cause;
while, furthermore, successive Martian years are not
alike. In some the season is early; in others late.
So that Mars is no more exempt than are we from the
wantonness of weather.</p>

<p class='c008' >Clearly disclosed thus reduced to its smallest possible
terms it remains for some months of our days, for six
weeks of its own. During that period it continues practically
unchanged, neither increasing nor decreasing
significantly in size, nor altering notably in aspect.
Measures of the drawings of it then make it from five
to eight degrees across and it is possible that it really
fluctuates between narrow limits, though its clear-cut
outline at all times renders the variation difficult to
explain. We are not so near it as we could wish;
for on these occasions even at their best it is over two
hundred times as distant as the moon and the greatest
magnification possible still leaves it a hundred thousand
miles away.</p>

<p class='c008' >To the south polar cap a somewhat similar history
attaches, but with a difference. In its case no such
regularly recurrent spring haze has yet been noted.
The melting of this cap would seem to be of a more
orderly nature than its fellow and not to outdo what
can conveniently be carried off.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
That an excess of evaporation should not take place
is the more peculiar from the fact that at its maximum
it is the larger of the two and therefore has the greater
quantity of matter to get rid of. Its summer, also,
is shorter than the arctic one, so that it has the less
time to dispose of its accumulations. The only other
respect in which it seems to be differently circumstanced
from its antipodes is in the character of its
surroundings. About it are large blue-green areas
which with intermissions stretch down in places to
within less than ten degrees of the equator; whereas
the other pole is continuously encircled for long distances
by practically uninterrupted ochre. The character
of the environment seems thus the only thing that
can account for the difference in behavior and this
proves the more plausible when we come to consider
what those two classes of regions respectively represent.</p>

<p class='c008' >In other ways as well the southern cap is the more
self-contained. The rifts, indeed, break it up into
separate portions and these in part remain as outlying
detachments of the main body, as was notably the
case in 1877 and in 1894, but they hardly have the
permanency and importance of those similarly formed
about the arctic pole. Nothing antarctic for instance
compares with the subsidiary patch of the north
polar regions lying in longitude 206°, which both
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
in Schiaparelli’s time, and during the late oppositions
as well was almost as fixed a feature of the
arctic zone as the cap proper. Not quite so constant,
however, and not so solid-looking a landmark is this
patch for all its extent, which nearly equals the area
of the more legitimate portion. It bears on its face a
more pallid complexion as if it were thinner, and this
is borne out by the fact that it occasionally disappears,
an event which so far at least has never befallen the
northern cap itself.</p>

<p class='c008' >Less constant the southern one is to its own minimum
than the northern. In some seasons, in most in fact,
it reaches like the other a more or less definite limit
of diminution which it does not pass. But this is not
always the case. In 1894 it disappeared entirely at
the height of its midsummer. The season was probably
unusually hot then in the southern hemisphere of Mars.</p>

<p class='c008' >In position the caps have something to say about
physiographic conditions. Both caps at their minima
are then irregular and the centre of the south one is
markedly eccentric to the areographic pole. It lies
some six degrees north along the thirtieth meridian.
The northern one is also probably eccentric, but much
less so, with a divergence not much exceeding a degree
and of doubtful orientation. Not only are both caps
not upon their respective poles but they are not opposite
each other, the one lying in longitude 30°, the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
in 290°. This speaks, of course, for local action. In
some wise this must depend on the configuration of the
surface, yet so far as markings go there is nothing to
show what the dependence is.</p>

<p class='c008' >The eccentring of the caps is paralleled by the like
state of things on earth. The pole of cold does not
coincide in either hemisphere with the geographic pole.
On the earth its position is largely determined by the
distribution of the land-masses. Continents are not
such equalizers of heat as oceans because of their conductivity
on the one hand and their immobility on the
other. In winter they part with their heat more quickly
and convection currents cannot supply the loss. This
accounting for thermal pole eccentricity is inapplicable
to Mars because of the absence there of bodies of water.
And it is significant that the degree the earthly poles
of cold are out much exceeds what is the case on Mars.
Possibly areas of vegetation there replace to some effect
areas of water. It is certainly in favor of this view that
the arctic regions there are more desert than the antarctic
and that the north pole of cold occupies more
squarely the geographic pole.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not till 1903 did the actual starting again of either
cap chance to be seen. Nor was this, indeed, a matter
of hazard but of persistent inquiry by observation
prolonged after the planet had got so far away that its
scanning had hitherto been discontinued. Such search
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
beyond the customary limits of observation was essential
to success, because of the relation of the axial tilt
to the position of the planet in its orbit. At an opposition
well placed for nearness, the tilt is such as largely
to hide the pole and to present the polar regions too
obliquely to view for effective scanning. This is true
both of the arctic and the antarctic regions in turn.
For the Martian axis being inclined somewhat as our
own is to the plane of the planet’s orbit, we at times
see well and at times but poorly the arctic or antarctic
zones.</p>

<p class='c008' >The cap, the starting to form of which was thus
caught, was the arctic one; the date 128 days after
the northern summer solstice, or thereabouts, for as is
perhaps natural the advent of the phenomenon partook
of the wavelike advance of such things familiar on
earth, an advance succeeded
by a recession and then followed
by another advance.
So much is proof of local
weather there as here. Hoar-frost
was successively deposited
and then melted off.</p>

 <img src='images/i_b_070.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='ce-caption'>Deposition of frost.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >What is significant, the
deposition of the frost took
place simultaneously over large areas. The very first
patch of it, in about longitude 320°, extended at one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
stroke down to latitude 55°. For it actually crossed
the Pierius somewhat to the south. A second patch
stretched to the east of the cap. Two wings these made
to the kernel of cap itself. Through the wings could
be marked the line of the canal: the Pierius upon the
one side, the Enipeus upon the other. Such visibility
of the canals through the white stretches proved
the white not to be due to cloud suspended between us
and them, but a surface deposit which found no lodgment
upon the canals themselves. The same avoidance
of dark markings was evidenced by the showing
of the dark rim round the cap’s kernel. Now, if the
deposit were indeed hoarfrost, this failure to find permanent
foothold on the dark markings is what we should
expect to witness. For whether they were vegetation
or water, equally in either case the frost would melt
from them first. Probably they were both vegetal,
though some doubt might exist about the latter, the
band around the kernel. It was then August 20 in
that hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c008' >Such deposition over great stretches of country is
perhaps not so surprising as it appears at first sight
when seen from without in its totality. After all,
something not unlike it occurs in our snow-storms when
hundreds of square miles are whitened at once. Furthermore,
with an atmosphere as thin as Mars seems
to possess the temperature must be perilously near the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
freezing-point in the arctic and subarctic regions at
the close of summer.</p>

<p class='c008' >Steadily, with intermissions, the white sheet increased
until even the dark border to the cap became obliterate,
the kernel showing at first through the veil like the
ghost of what it had been, and then ceasing to be visible
at all, its delimitations being buried under deeper and
deeper depositions of frost.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>First northern snow.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The perennial portion of the cap was thus merged
in the new-fallen snow. This marked the on-coming of
the arctic winter in full force
and happened even before
the polar sun had wholly set.
For the pole did not enter
into the shadow till two of
our months later, the autumnal
equinox occurring
183 days after the summer
solstice or 55 days after the
first fall of frost. Then the pole passed into its star-strewn
arctic night, a polar night of twice the duration
of our own and the circumpolar regions entered upon
their long hibernation of ten of our months.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_9 c015'     >In addition to the polar caps proper and to the
subsidiary polar patches that often in late summer
flank them round about, other white spots may
from time to time be seen upon the disk. In appearance
these differ in no respect, so far as observed,
from the arctic subsidiary snow-fields. Of the same
pure argent, they sparkle on occasion in like manner
with the sheen of ice. Equally with the polar caps
they remain permanent in place during the period of
their visibility and are themselves long-lived. Though
by no means perpetual their duration is reckoned by
weeks and even months, and they recur with more or
less persistency at successive Martian years. That,
when seen, they show in particular positions apparently
unaffected by diurnal change precludes their being
clouds, and this fact taken in connection with the
character of their habitat is the puzzling point about
them. For they affect chiefly the north tropic belt.
They, or at least their nuclei, are small, about two or
three degrees in diameter, and are not particularly
easy of detection as a rule, though certain larger ones
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
are at times conspicuous. Chromatic, rather than
formal, definition is necessary to their bringing out, as
is witnessed by the superb colors the disk presents at
the times when they are best seen. It is then that
Mars puts on the look of a fire-opal.</p>

<p class='c008' >The first such spot to be noticed was one which
Schiaparelli detected in 1879, at the second opposition
in which he studied the planet. He called it the Nix
Olympica, showing that he recognized in it a cousinship
to the polar snows. Yet it lay in latitude 20°
north, longitude<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c022'><sup>[1]</sup></a> 131°, in the midst of the ochre
stretches of that part of the disk. It was a small
roundish white speck of not more than two thirds the
diameter of the polar cap. Reseen by him in 1881,
it failed to appear at subsequent oppositions and was
not caught again until 1888. Then once more it vanished,
not to be detected anew till many years after
at Flagstaff, coming out rather surprisingly in 1903.
It showed, however, in the same place as before;
so that its position but not its existence is permanent.</p>

<p class='c008' >A similar but smaller patch was apparent to Schiaparelli
at the same opposition of 1879. This one which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
he styled the Nix Atlantica lay between the Thoth
and the Syrtis Major. It was about half the size of the
Nix Olympica and has never since been seen, though
it should have been had it continued to be what it then
was.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>White in Elysium.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >On the other hand, phenomena of the sort undetected
of Schiaparelli have been remarked at Flagstaff. On
May 18, 1901, I was suddenly
struck by the singular
whiteness of the southeast
corner of Elysium where
that region bordered the
Trivium. Elysium has a
way of being bright but not
with such startling intensity
as this spot presented nor
in so restricted an area as was here the case. The
spot was so much whiter than anything I had ever
previously seen outside the polar caps that it arrested
my attention at once. And this the more that I had
observed this same part of the planet the day before
and perceived nothing out of the ordinary. Once
detected, however, the spot continued visible. The
next day it was there with equal conspicuousness, and
now thrust an arm across the Cerberus, entirely obliterating
the canal for the space of several degrees.
In this salience it remained day after day till the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
region passed from sight, to reappear with it six
weeks later when the region again rounded into view.
The hour of the Martian day seemed to make no
difference in its visibility. It was seen from early
morning till Martian afternoon, as late as the phase
permitted. Clearly there was nothing diurnal about
its revealing, and it lasted for at least three months
and a half, until the planet got so far away that
observations were discontinued.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was to all appearances and intents snow. But
now comes the singular fact about it. It lay within
ten degrees of the equator and showed from the end of
June to the latter part of August. To our ideas there
could be no more inopportune place or time for such
an exhibition. For it cannot have been due to a snow-capped
peak, as we know for certain that there are no
mountains in this, or in any other, part of the planet.
Besides, it had not appeared in previous Martian
years; which it infallibly would have done had it been
a peak. Indeed, it baffles explanation beyond any
Martian phenomenon known to me. It seems directly
to contradict every other detail presented by the
disk.</p>

<p class='c008' >The phenomenon is thus unique in kind; it is not,
however, unique as a specimen of its kind. The eastern
coast of Aeria where that region borders the Syrtis
Major is prone to a brilliance of the same sort. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
a narrow belt of country that shows thus, nothing but
the coastline itself, but this for a considerable distance
stretching several hundred miles in length. It has
stood out saliently bright now at every opposition
which I have observed, beginning with 1894. Sometimes
it has been described in the notes as bright
simply, sometimes as white, and once, in 1901, as glistening
at one point like ice. Yet when upon the terminator
it has never stood forth as a mountain range
should have done to declare its character.</p>

<p class='c008' >It has been evident regardless apparently of the Martian
season. In 1894 it was bright from October 25
to January 16 (Martian chronology); in 1896, from
December 22 to January 7; in 1901, from July 13 to
the 15th; in 1903, at about the same date and so in
1905. It was whitest during the latter oppositions,
showing that the effect is most marked in its midsummer.
All of the above instances of extra-polar
white have been located within the tropics. Examples
of the same thing, however, occur in the north temperate
zone. Tempe, a region just to the west of the
Mare Acidalium, is exceedingly given to showing a
small white spot close upon the Mare’s border in
latitude 50° north. This spot, too, on occasion
glitters as it were with ice. It is also at times very
small. So that whereas much of Tempe is by nature
bright but a small kernel of it is dazzling.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
The list might be easily extended from the record
book. Thus on March 1 and 2, 1903, the disk showed
speckled with minute white spots, one in Arcadia in
latitude 41° north, one in
Tharsis near the equator, a
third just north of the
Phoenix Lucus in 10° south,
and a fourth, the Nix
Olympica, and on April 11,
a glittering pin-point starred
like a diamond the centre of
the Pons Hectoris. On both
these occasions the Martian season was summer;
July 9 for the latter, June 21 for the former date.</p>

<div class='illus-300'>
 <img src='images/i_b_078.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='ce-caption'>White in the Pons Hectoris.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >As one approaches the north pole spots of like character
become more numerous. Especially are such
visible north of the Mare Acidalium in the arctic region
thereabout, from 63° to 75° north.</p>

<p class='c008' >From so widespread a set of instances the only explanation
which seems to fit the phenomena is that the
mean temperature of Mars is low, not very much above
freezing, and that whatever causes a local fall in the
temperature results in hoar-frost. Such an explanation
accords well with the distance of the planet from the
sun and the thinness of its atmosphere. At the same
time it shows that the mean temperature over the
greater part of the planet the greater part of the time
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
is above the freezing-point and that consequently
it is no bar to vegetation of a suitable sort.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the hoar-frost should be found even at the
equator may perhaps be due to the very thinness of
the air-covering of Mars, which would tend to make
the actual insolation more of a factor than it is with us,
and by the great length of the Martian seasons. In
midsummer the greatest insolation occurs in the arctic
and temperate, not in the tropic regions; on the other
hand, an atmosphere tends to accumulate heat for the
tropics. With us the latter factor is prepotent; it
would be less effective on Mars. Then again the double
duration of summer would tend to emphasize insolation
as the important factor in the matter. But it is
possible that greater deposition plays a part in the
matter. On earth the rainfall is greatest near the
equator and something of the sort may be true of the
zones of moisture on Mars. That the most striking spots
are found to the west of large dark areas may in this
connection have a meaning inasmuch as, such regions
being vegetation-covered, the air over them is probably
more moisture-laden.</p>

<p class='c008' >One point about the position of the spots is of
moment: they have all been found in the northern
hemisphere or within ten degrees of it in the southern
equatorial region. This seems at first a question of
hemispheres; but when we consider that the light areas
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
of the surface are chiefly in the boreal hemisphere and in
the south tropic belt, we perceive that it may be rather
the character of the surface there than the particular
hemisphere in the abstract that is decisive in the matter.
Nevertheless, the austral hemisphere is the hemisphere
of extremes, possessing a shorter, hotter summer and
a longer, colder winter than its antipodes. This would
not favor sporadic small depositions of frost in summer
so much as would a climate of a more mean temperature.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the relative lack of atmospheric covering over
the planet we should expect the nights to prove decidedly
cool, while the days were fairly warm. Of this
we have perhaps evidence in a singular aspect shown
by the Mare Acidalium in June, 1903. The account
of it in the Annals reads thus: “On May 22 an interesting
and curious phenomenon presented itself. On
that day, so soon as the Mare Acidalium had well
rounded the terminator on to the disk, at λ352°, the
whole of its central part showed white, the edges of
the marking alone remaining as a shell to this brilliant
core. So striking was the effect that beside appearing
in the drawing it found echo in the notes. The
next day no mention is made of it, and a drawing
made under λ20° shows the Mare as usual and the
bright spot in Tempe in its customary place. Neither
was anything of the sort noticed on the 24th and 25th.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
But on the 26th, the day of the projection (upon the
terminator), the effect of the 23d reappeared, the longitude
of the centre being 332°. Fortunately on that
day a further drawing was secured which enabled its
subsequent behavior to be followed. Made three hours
later than the other, the longitude of the centre being
13°, this drawing shows the Mare well on the disk, its
whole area as dark as usual and with Tempe bright to
the right of it toward the terminator. The terminator
in question was the sunrise one, and we are offered two
suppositions in explanation of the phenomenon: either
the white was due to a morning deposition of hoar-frost
which dissipated as the sun got up, or obliquity rendered
some superficial deposit visible which more vertical
vision hid. That the former inference is the more
probable seems hinted at by the simultaneous appearance
from the 19th to the 26th of other areas of white
between the Mare and the pole. May 26 was 88 days
after the northern summer solstice, and corresponded
to July 31 on the earth.” Annals, Volume III, §564.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this connection mention may pertinently be made
of Schiaparelli’s repeated observation of regions that
whiten with obliquity, a proclivity to which he particularly
noticed Hellas and certain ‘islands’ in the
Mare Erythraeum to be prone. Here as with the Mare
Acidalium we certainly seem to be envisaging cases of
matutinal frost melted by midday under the sun’s rays.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_9 c015'     >In gazing at the successive phases presented by the
polar caps as their annual history unrolls itself to
view, beginning with vast white cloaks that in winter
hide so effectively the planet’s shoulders, to little round
knobs that in summer sit like guardsmen’s caps more or
less askew upon the poles, the bodily eye sees only the
glisten of far-off snow. The mind’s eye, however,
perceives something more: the conviction they carry
of the presence of an atmosphere surrounding the
planet. Elusive as water vapor is to sight for its
transparency and to spectroscopic determination for
its earthly omnipresence, recognition of its existence
elsewhere by deduction raises such reasoning at once
to a more conspicuous plane than it might otherwise
assume. Especially is this true where the deduction is
itself conclusive, as is here the case. For it depends
on phenomena not its own, but which are in their turn
dependent on it. We are not even beholden to any
knowledge of the substance composing the caps for the
fundamental inference that an atmosphere surrounds
them. Whatever that substance were, the fact that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
the caps dissipate and reform shows us with absolute
certainty that they pass into the gaseous state, to be
later solidified afresh. This gas constitutes of itself
an atmosphere; while another phenomenon, to wit,
their blue girdles as they melt, affirming their substance
to be snow and ice, enables us to precise the fact that
this gas is water vapor.</p>

<p class='c008' >From such premise given us by the polar caps we are
able to infer much more by the help of the kinetic
theory of gases. But the speed of parting by a
planet with its gases is conditioned by the mean
speed of each gas. Water vapor will, therefore, go
before nitrogen, oxygen or carbonic acid gas. If,
then, we find it present over the surface of a planet
we are assured of the possibility that the other three
may be there too, and from the similarity of matter
in space strong reason to suspect that they actually
are.</p>

<p class='c008' >Corroborative evidence of the accuracy of the deduction
as to the presence of a Martian air is shown in
several other ways; in the existence of clouds to begin
with. Rare as they are, these certainly float at times
over parts of the planet, although it is doubtful whether
they can then be seen. Fortunately for assurance we
have other ways of ascertaining their presence than
that of obscuration. Nor is it of account to the argument
that they should be few and far between, as they
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
unquestionably are. One single instance of such mediumistic
support is enough to support the theory of a
medium; and that instance has been more than once
observed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Direct evidence of atmosphere is further forthcoming
in the limb-light. This phenomenon might be described
as a brilliant obscuration. It is a circlet of
illumination that swamps the features as they near the
full edge of the disk, the limb of the planet as it is
called. Obliteration of the sort is evident, more or
less markedly, at all times, and is not due to foreshortening,
as the broadest areas are affected. The fading
out of the detail at the limb suggests nothing so much
as a veil drawn between us and it, lighter in tint than
what it covers. Such a veil can be none other than
air or the haze and cloud that air supports. From its
effect, impartial in place and partial in character,
cloud is inadmissible as a cause and we are left with air
charged with dust or vapor in explanation. Obscuration
due to it should prove most dense at the limb,
since there the eye has to penetrate a greater depth of
it; just as on the earth our own air gives azure dimness
to the distance in deepened tinting as the mountains
lie remote.</p>

<p class='c008' >Another bit of evidence lies in the apparent detection
of a twilight arc. In 1894 measures made of the
polar and equatorial diameters of the planet showed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
certain systematic residuals left after all known corrections
had been applied. The only thing which would
account for them was the supposition that a twilight
arc had been unconsciously seen and as unconsciously
measured. In delicate quantities of the sort too great
reliance cannot be put, but if the residuals be not referable
to other cause they give us not only further evidence
of an atmosphere, but at the same time our only
hint of that atmosphere’s extent. From them it
would seem that the air must be rare, not more than
about four inches of barometric pressure, as we reckon
it, and probably less; a thin, high air more rarefied
than prevails upon our highest mountain tops.</p>

<p class='c008' >Corroborative of this is the aspect of the planet.
From the general look of the disk a scant covering
of air is inferable. For one of the striking things
about the planet’s features is their patent exposure to
our sight. Except in the winter time of its hemisphere
or in the spring after the greatest melting of the polar
cap, nothing seems to stand in our way of an uninterrupted
view of the surface, whether in the arctic, temperate,
or tropic zones. From the openness of its
expression, however, too much case should not be
made as we really know but little of how an atmosphere-enshrouded
planet would look. We find no difficulty
in seeing objects a hundred miles away across the surface
of the earth and yet the thickness of the air strata
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
in such horizontal traversing is many fold what it is
when we look directly up. It is also out of all proportion
laden with dust and smoke. In the purer regions
of the earth, a clear air imposes but little bar to sight,
and conjures up far things startlingly distinct.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nevertheless, every evidence points to a thin air
upon Mars: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> reasoning, indirect deduction and
direct sight. Now, from a thinness of atmosphere it
would follow, other things equal, that the climate was
cold. About this there has been much question, but
less of answering reply. From the distance of the
planet from the sun it is certain less heat is received
by it than falls upon the earth in something like the
ratio of one to two. But that the amount effective
is as the amount received is far from sure. The available
heat is much affected by the manner of its reception.
A blanket of air acts like the glass of a conservatory,
letting the light rays in, but hindering the heat
rays out. The light rays falling on the ground or the
air are transformed into heat rays that, finding the return
journey less easy, are consequently trapped. All
substances are thus calorifiers, but water vapor is
many times more potent than ordinary air to heat-ensnaring.
A humid air has a hothouse tang to it most
perceptible. Now, what the relative percentage of
water vapor in the Martian atmosphere may be we
do not know.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
The thinness of the Martian air has caused it to be
likened to that upon our highest mountain peaks
which are in large part covered with perpetual snow.
But the comparison is not well founded. A peak differs
materially from a plateau in the countenance it gives
to the heat falling upon it. On a plateau each warmed
acre of ground helps the retention of heat by its neighbor;
while in addition to being destitute of side support
the higher winds generated about an isolated peak blow
its own caloric away. Still less does any analogy hold
between the two when the plateau is a world-wide one.</p>

<p class='c008' >From these considerations it is evident glosses are
possible upon the bald idea of a much lower temperature
prevailing on the Martian surface than on the earth’s.
Doubtless the theoretic cold has been greatly overdone.
Reversely, recent observations tend to lower the apparent
temperature disclosed by the features of the disk,
and between the rising of the theoretic and the falling
of the observed we are left with a very reasonable
compromise and reconcilement as the result.</p>

<p class='c008' >The various look and behavior of the surface of Mars
point to a mean temperature colder than that of the
earth, but above the freezing-point of water; for
regions, at least, outside of the polar caps and during
all but the winter months. Except at certain special
spots, and possibly even there, frost is unknown at all
times within the tropics and except in winter in temperate
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
latitudes. These anomalous localities, mentioned
in the preceding chapter, may be said to be the
exceptions that prove the rule of general non-glaciation.
For if they be snow, they stand witness to its
absence elsewhere upon the disk, and if they are not,
they testify the more emphatically to the same effect.</p>

<p class='c008' >As between different parts of the surface, the tilt
of the Martian axis and the greater length of the Martian
seasons, the one the same as, the other the double
of, our own, tend to an accentuation of the heat in the
temperate and arctic or antarctic zones. The greatest
insolation on earth is not, as we might suppose, at the
equator, but at the parallels of 43.°5 north and south;
even the poles themselves receiving a quarter as much
heat again on midsummer day as ever falls to the lot of
the line. This broad physical fact is equally true of
Mars, while in the matter of consecutive exposure Mars
in summer outdoes the earth. For the longer the seasons,
the more nearly does the effective heat approach
the received amount. Thus both on the score of heat
received and of heat husbanded these zones must be
relatively warm. And this shows itself in the look of
the surface. In summer it is clearly warmer within
the polar regions than is the case on earth, to judge by
the effect. In winter the cold is doubtless proportionately
severe.</p>

<p class='c008' >For the diurnal range of temperature we have less
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
data. There is evidence pointing to chilly nights, but
it is meagre, and we are left to fall back on the cold of
our deserts at night for analogic condition of the state
of things over the Martian desert levels after the sun
goes down.</p>

<p class='c008' >If we are uncertain of the precise character of the
Martian climate, we know on the other hand a good deal
about the Martian weather. A pleasing absence of it
over much of the planet distinguishes Martian conditions
from our own. That we can scan the surface as we do
without practical interruption day in and day out
proves the weather over it to be permanently fair. In
fact a clear sky, except in winter, and in many places
even then, is not only the rule, but the rule almost
without exceptions. In the early days of Martian
study cases of obscuration were recorded from time
to time by observers, in which portions of the disk were
changed or hidden as if clouds were veiling them from
view. More modern observations fail to support this
deduction, partly by absence of instances, partly by
other explanation of the facts. Certainly the recorded
instances are very rare. Indeed, occasions of the sort
must to any Martians be events, since only one possible
example has presented itself to me during the course
of my observations, extending more or less over eleven
years. Even in this case there was no obliteration,
though a certain whiteness overspread an area near
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
the equator temporarily. Position seemed to point to
its identity with a cloud which made its appearance
about that time upon the terminator, and lasted for
some thirty-six hours. The cloud, however, showed
evidence of being, not the kind with which we are familiar,
but a dust-storm, in keeping, indeed, with the
desert region (Chryse) in which it originated.</p>

<p class='c008' >With the exception of sporadic disturbance of the sort
the whole surface of the planet outside the immediate
vicinity of the polar caps seems free from cloud or mist
and to lie perpetually unveiled to space. In the neighborhood
of the caps, however, and especially round
about their edge, a very distinct pearly appearance is
presented during the months at which the cap is at its
maximum, or in other words, in the depth of its winter.
Of a dull white hue and indefinite contour the phenomenon
suggests cloud. Where it lies spread no markings
are visible; an absence explicable by obscuration due
an interposed medium, but equally well by seasonal
non-existence of the markings themselves, which from
the general behavior of these markings we know to be
to some extent certainly the fact. Of the regions
where the effect is noticeable, Hellas is the most striking.
So conspicuously white during the winter of the
southern hemisphere as to have been often mistaken for
the polar cap, its ghost shows thus almost regularly every
Martian year. What is as suggestive as it is striking,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
the blanching is confined to the solid circle constituting
Hellas and does not extend into the dark regions by
which it is circumscribed. Hellas is as self-contained
when thus powdered as when, in its normal ochre or
abnormal red, it stretches like a broad buckler across
the body of the disk. That the land there lies at a
higher level than its surroundings is pretty certain, but
that the difference can amount to enough to explain its
silveriness as ice is improbable. In latitude Hellas is
distinctly temperate, lying between the parallels of 55°
and 30°; but on Mars this is no warrant of a like climate.
Again, though close on the south to what constitutes
the polar cap, it does not strictly form part of that cap,
but occupies both in position and in kind a something
intermediary between the frost-bound regions of periodic
snow and the warmer ones of perpetual sunshine.
It seems to be afflicted with the winter weather of the
north of Europe, and to owe its pearly look at such times
to the same cloud canopy that then distressingly covers
those inclement lands.</p>

<p class='c008' >Similar in behavior to it is the long chain of so-called
islands that, beginning southwest of Thaumasia,
runs thence westward even to the eastern edge
of Hellas. These belt the planet in a west-northwesterly
direction by a strip of territory from ten to fifteen degrees
wide, the medial line of which begins at 55°
south and ends in about 40°. They are parted from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
the main bright areas by blue-green ‘seas’ of about the
same width as themselves, the Mare Sirenum, the Mare
Cimmerium and Mare Tyrrhenum. These ‘seas’
the white that covers the ‘islands’ never crosses;
though the continent, as we may call it for convenience,
descends at the east to 30° south. Since the ‘seas’
are not seas, the cause which might bound the snow,
were they such, cannot be the cause here. Nevertheless,
they have an effect of some sort on the isothermal
lines as is shown not only by latitudinal comparison
with the state of things in Hellas, but with that in
Thaumasia as well. For 30° south is also the limit apparently
of the white on Thaumasia, where ochre desert
stretches ten degrees farther south still; the region in
its southern part being white-mantled, in its northern
part not. Here again, then, the ochre areas make
exception to what affects the blue-green ones. Clearly
the blue-green regions temper the action of what gives
them wintry cloak. But why they should do this is
not easy to explain on any supposition terrestrial or
marine. Bodies of water tend to foster the formation
of clouds; so, less markedly, do areas of vegetation.
Neither the old ideas, then, nor the new lend themselves
in explanation. It may be that while we here seem
to be envisaging cloud we are in reality looking at hoar-frost.
On the other hand, light cloud would show less,
superposed over a dark background, than over an ochre
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
one; and this, the simplest of all explanations, may be
the true one. It is facts like these that intrigue us in
the study of the Martian surface by revealing conditions
which render offhand analogy with the earth unsafe.
Indeed, we are more sure of some things which appear
too strange to be true than of others so simple on their
face as to enlist belief. Among the most difficult
and perplexing are meteorological problems like the
above. Here we can only say provisionally that while
cloud best answers to the appearance, frost best fits the
cause. For vegetation might melt frost, yet not dissipate
cloud. By raising our conception of the mean
temperature the facts can, however, be reconciled and
this is probably the solution of the difficulty after all.</p>

<p class='c008' >As we saw in the annual history of the polar caps a
dimness somewhat different affects the northern cap in
May and June. After the melting of the cap is well
under way a haziness sets in along its edge which befuddles
its outline and effectually hides what is going
on within it. When at last the screen clears away the
cap is found to be reduced to its least dimensions.
Such obstructing sheet looks to be more of the nature
of mist caused by the excessive melting of the cap.
Unfortunately, there are here no patches of blue-green
to test a possible partiality in its behavior over such
tracts; nor has similar action ever yet been remarked
in the case of the cap of the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
Regular recurrence at the appropriate season of the
planet’s year, together with extensive action at the
time, takes this springtide mist to some extent out of
the domain of weather into that of climate. For it
prevails all round the cap and repeats itself in place
as each fresh spring comes on. At least it has done so
for the past three oppositions at which it has been possible
to observe well the arctic zones. It is thus both
general in its application and fixed in its behavior.
Nevertheless, it betrays something of the fickleness
which characterizes that more inconstant thing:
weather. For it comes and goes, one thinks for good,
only to find it there again some days later. Not less
captious is the meteorologic action shown in the making
of the new polar cap. When the northern one starts
to form, vast areas of frost are deposited in a single
night. These, however, are not permanent. The
ground thus covered is during the next few days again
partially laid bare. Then a new fall occurs, hiding the
surface a little more completely than before, and the
lost domain is more than regained. By such wavelike
advance and recession the tide of frost creeps over
and submerges the arctic regions as the late summer
passes into the autumn. In this alternate coming and
going with succeeding days, we have an unsteadfastness
of action most fittingly paralleled by our own
weather. It would seem that local causes there as here
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
are superposed upon the orderly progress of the seasons
and though at the on-coming of the autumn the
cold is steadily gathering strength, nevertheless warm
days occur now and then to stay its hand, only to be
succeeded in their turn by frosts more biting than before.
Even on Mars nothing in the way of weather
is absolutely predicable but impredicability.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_9 c015'     >In all ways but one our scrutiny of the planet is
confined to such view as we might get of it from
the car of a balloon poised above it in space; from
which disadvantage-point we should see the surface
only as a map spread out below us, a matter of but
two dimensions. The exception consists in the observation
of what are called projections; irregularities
visible when the disk is gibbous upon that edge of the
planet where the light fades off. Striking phenomena
in themselves they are of particular value for what may
be deduced from them. For by them we are afforded
our only opportunity of gaining knowledge of the surface
other than in plan and thus of determining between
peak, plateau, or plain that to a bird’s-eye view
alike lie flattened out to one dead level.</p>

<p class='c008' >It might at first be thought that our best chance of
noting any elevations or depressions of the Martian
surface lay in catching that surface in profile, by scanning
the bright edge of it which stands sharp-cut
against the sky and is called the limb. For this is
practically what we do on earth when we mark a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
mountain against the horizon and measure its height
by triangulation. Unfortunately the method fails in
the case of Mars because of the great distance we are
away. Unless the planet were distinctly more generously
equipped than the earth in the matter of
mountains, nothing could be hoped from so forthright
an envisaging. So relatively insignificant to the size
of its globe is the relief of the earth’s surface that an
orange skin would seem grossly rough by comparison.
The same proves true for Mars. With the greatest
magnification we can produce, the Martian limb still
appears perfectly smooth.</p>

<p class='c008' >Luckily, while direct vision is thus impossible, oblique
illumination enables us to get an insight into the
character of the surface we had otherwise been
denied. When mountains or valleys chance to lie
upon the boundary of light and darkness, the rim of
the disk known as the terminator in contradistinction
to the limb where the surface itself comes to an end,
they make their presence evident through an indirect
species of magnification, the elongate effect of oblique
lighting. With a practical instance of it every one
is familiar who has walked by night along a road imperfectly
starred at intervals by electric lights. Startled
between posts by what seemed deep holes and high
furrows he has involuntarily imitated a spavined horse
for fear of stubbing his toes, only to encounter when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
his foot fell a surface on contact surprisingly smooth.
The slant illumination by lengthening the shadows
had painfully deceived him into exaggerated inference
of irregularity. What proves disturbing to a wayfarer
misguided by arc lights is made to do the
eye service when it comes to planetary interpretation.
On the boundary of light and shade, those
parts of the surface where it is sunrise or sunset
upon the planet, the sun’s rays fall so athwartwise
as to throw enormous shadows from quite small elevations
to an eye so placed as to view the surface with
anything approaching perpendicularity. A mountain
mass there will thus proclaim itself by protracted profile
upon the plain in hundredfold magnification. Similarly
a peak there will advertise its height by catching
the coming or holding the lingering light at many times
the distance of its own elevation away from the night
side of the planet. Here, if anywhere, then, could
mountains be expected to disclose themselves, and
here, when existent, they have as a matter of fact
been found.</p>

<p class='c008' >Our own moon offers us the first and easiest example
of such vicariously visible relief. When the moon is
near the quarter, and for three or four days on either
side of that, a keen eye can usually detect one or more
knobs, like warts, projecting from its terminator,
easily distinguished from the limb both by reason of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
being less bright and of being bounded by a semi-ellipse
instead of a semicircle. If a telescope or even an opera-glass
be substituted for the eye, it is possible to see
what causes them; the knob resolves itself into the
illuminated rim of a crater separated from the main
body of the visible moon by the seemingly black void of
space. The peak has caught the sunlight, while its
foot and the country between it and the illuminated
surface still lies shrouded in shadow.</p>

<p class='c008' >From measurement of the distance the sun-tipped
peak seems to stand aloof from the line where the plain
itself is touched by the light, the height of it above that
plain may be calculated. In this way have been found
the heights of the mountains of the moon. Incidentally,
brain outstrips brawn. For pinnacles no Lunarian
could scale, both for their precipitous inaccessibility
and their loftiness, man has measured without so
much as setting foot upon their globe. At each lunar
sunrise and again at lunar sunset these old crater walls
show their crescent coronets tipped the reverse way;
and peaks higher than the Himalayas make gigantic
gnomons of themselves with hands outstretched to grasp
the plains.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this manner a lunar peak of fifteen thousand feet
shows its presence to the unaided eye. With so much
for starting-point we can calculate how low an elevation
could similarly be made out on Mars under a like
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
phase illumination. Now, in spheres of different diameters
the distance out from the terminator for a given
height is as the square root of the diameter. Mars has
about twice the size of the Moon. In consequence, if
we saw the planet at the same distance off as the Moon,
the height of a peak upon it sufficient to cast an equal
shadow or be seen at an equal separation from the
terminator need be but two thirds as high. To see
it thus equidistant a power of 250 or 300 is necessary,
dependent on the opposition. Twice this power may
at times be used, and by the same reasoning this
would reduce the height sufficient to show by four
or to something like 2500 feet. This, then, would be
the theoretic limit of the visible, a limit needing to
be somewhat increased because of the imperfection of
our air.</p>

<p class='c008' >Having found thus what should be visible on Mars
we turn now to see what is. At once we find ourselves
confronted with a very unlunar state of things. Common
upon the face of the Moon, excrescences of the
terminator are rare on Mars. The first ever seen was
detected by a visitor at the Lick Observatory in 1888.
Since then they have been repeatedly noticed both at
the Lick and elsewhere. But although observers are
now on the watch for them, they are not very frequently
chronicled because not of everyday occurrence.
Much depends upon the opposition; some approaches
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
of the planet proving more prolific of them than others.
How rare they are, however, may be gathered from the
fact that the last three oppositions have disclosed but
one apiece.</p>

<p class='c008' >An account of the great projection of May 25, 1903,
will give an idea of the extent and interest of the phenomenon
and will serve to show to what cause we must
attribute all such that have been visible on Mars, for
the behavior of this one was typical of the class.</p>

<div id='i_b_101' class='imgright'>

<p class='ce-caption'>Projection on terminator.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >About half past eight o’clock in the evening of May
26, 1903, Mr. V. M. Slipher, astronomer at Flagstaff,
shortly after taking over the telescope then directed
upon Mars, suddenly noticed a large projection about
halfway up the terminator
of the planet. He at once
sent word of the fact and
the observatory staff turned
out to see it, for a projection
has for workers on Mars
the like interest that a new
comet possesses for astronomers
generally. In this case
the phenomenon was specially potent in that it was
the first to be detected that year. Its singularity was
amply seconded by its size. For it was very large, its
extent both in length and height being excessive.
When I first saw it, the projection consisted of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
oval patch of light, a little to the north of the centre
of the phase ellipse lying parallel to the terminator
but parted from it by darkness to the extent of half
the projection’s own width. It made thus not simply
an excrescence but a detached islet of light. It was
easily seen by all those present and was carefully
studied from that time on by Mr. Slipher and me.
Both of us made drawings of it alternately at intervals,
as well as micrometer measures of its position.</p>

<p class='c008' >Next to its great size, the most striking feature about
it was its color. This, instead of being white or whitish,
was ochre orange, a hue closely assimilated to the tint
of the subjacent parts of the disk, which was the region
known as Chryse. This distinctive complexion it kept
throughout the period of its apparition. At the same
time Baltia, a region to the north of it and synchronously
visible close upon the terminator, showed whitish.
The seeing was good enough to disclose the Phison and
Euphrates double, the power a magnification of 310
and the aperture the full aperture of the 24-inch
objective.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the time it was first seen the detached patch
of light crept in toward the disk, the illuminated body
of the planet. Four minutes after I noted it the dark
space separating it from the nearest point of the terminator
had sensibly lessened. So it continued, with
some fluctuations intrinsic to the atmospheric difficulties
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
of observations generally and to the smallness
of the object itself, to become gradually less and less
salient. It lasted for about forty minutes from the
moment it had first appeared to Mr. Slipher and then
passed from sight to leave the edge of the planet smooth
and commonplace again.</p>

<p class='c008' >The measures made on it showed that it lay when
first seen in longitude 39°.7, latitude 18°.5 north, and
that its highest point stood seventeen miles above the
surface of the planet. It was three hundred miles
long. These are my own figures, from which Mr.
Slipher’s do not substantially differ.</p>

<p class='c008' >The return of the part of the planet where it had been
seen was eagerly awaited the night after by both
observers, to see if it would bring the projection with it.
For only once a day is the same region of Mars similarly
presented. But in order not to miss the projection,
should it be ahead of time, observations were begun
before it was due. Shortly after they were started,
there appeared higher up the terminator and therefore
farther north than had been the case the night before,
a small projection. It was with difficulty made out
and its position measured. Without careful watching
it must have been missed altogether. As it was, it
differed in every respect from that of the preceding
day. It was not nearly so high, not nearly so large,
and lay in a different place on the planet, being now
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
in longitude 31°.7, latitude 25°.5. Either the two,
therefore, were totally different things or the projection
had moved in the elapsed interval of time over
seven degrees of latitude and eight degrees of longitude,
a distance of three hundred and ninety miles in twenty-four
hours. Where the previous projection had been
nothing showed. On the following night, May 28, no
trace of anything unusual could be seen anywhere.</p>

<p class='c008' >We are now concerned to inquire to what this series
of appearances could have been due. The first observers
of projections on Mars had unhesitatingly attributed
them to the same cause that produces projections
on the Moon, to wit, mountains. Such they were
held to be in France and at the Lick. This view, however,
was in 1892 disputed by W. H. Pickering who
considered them to be not mountains, but cloud. And
this view was strongly supported by A. E. Douglass
in a discussion of a large number of them observed in
1894 at Flagstaff. The mountain theory of their
generation was finally shown to be untenable and their
ascription to cloud conclusively proved to be the correct
solution by the observations of a remarkable
one made in December, 1900, and the careful
study to which by the writer they were subjected.
We shall now explain how this was done and we will
begin by pointing out that the fact that only a single
specimen of the phenomenon was visible at each of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
three oppositions of 1900, 1903, and 1905 was itself
conclusive, rightly viewed, of their non-mountainous
character. This conclusion follows at once from the
isolateness of the phenomenon. For a mountain cannot
change its place. Now, the shift in the aspect presented
by the planet’s disk from one night to the next is not
sufficient to alter perceptibly the appearance shown
by anything upon its edge on the two occasions. If,
then, a peak stood out upon it one evening, the peak
should again show salient when the region reached the
same position upon the succeeding night. That nothing
then was seen where something had previously
been visible proved the phenomenon not that of a
mountain peak, since what produced the projection
was clearly not fixed in place and therefore not attached
to the soil. Now the only other thing capable of catching
the light before it reached the surface would be
something suspended in the air, that is, a cloud. Deduction,
therefore, from the rarity of the phenomenon
alone showed that the projections must be clouds.</p>

<p class='c008' >Their behavior in detail entirely corroborates this
deduction from their intermittence. Such was shown
by the action of the projection of December 6, 1900,
as set forth in a paper before the American Philosophical
Society and such again by that of the one of May
26, 1903, as we shall now note. To begin with, we
notice that the projection seen on May 26 was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
found either <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i> or in size on May 27 and had wholly
vanished on May 28, though the seeing was substantially
the same if not better on the two nights succeeding
that of its original detection. Hence in its own
instance this projection proved an alibi irreconcilable
with the character of a mountain mass. But it did
more. It not only was not on the second evening
what and where it had been on the first, but the remains
of it visible on the second occasion showed clearly that
it had moved in the meantime. Furthermore it was
disappearing as it went, for it was very much smaller
after the lapse of twenty-four hours. The something
that caused it was not only not attached to the soil,
but was moving and dissipating as it moved. Only
one class of bodies known to us can account for these
metamorphoses and that is: cloud.</p>

<p class='c008' >But what kind of cloud are we to conceive it to be?
Our ordinary vapor clouds are whitish and this would
be still more their color could they be looked at from
above. The Martian cloud was not white but tawny,
of the tint exhibited by a cloud of dust. Nor could
this color have very well been lent it by its sunrise
position, for other places equally situated to be tinged
by the hues of that time of day, Baltia to wit, showed
distinctly white. So that we must suppose it to be
what it looked, a something of the soil, not beholden
to atmospheric tinting for its hue; a vast dust-cloud
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
traveling slowly over the desert and settling slowly
again to the ground.</p>

<p class='c008' >Precisely the same general course of drifting disappearance
was taken by the projection of December 7
and 8, 1900. And this, too, stood an unique apparition
in the annals of its opposition. Clouds, then, and
not mountains are the explanation of the projections
on Mars, differing thus completely from the lunar ones.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Descending now equatorwards from the polar
regions, and their in part paleocrystic, in part
periodic, coating of ice, we come out upon the general
uncovered expanse of the planet which in winter comprises
relatively less surface than on Earth, but in summer
relatively more. Forty degrees and eighty-six
degrees may be taken as the mean hiemal and æstival
limits respectively of the snow on Mars; forty-five
and seventy-five as those of the Earth. Whatever
ground is thus bared of superficial covering on Mars lies
fully exposed to view, thanks to the absence of obscuring
cloud; and it is at once evident that the <a id='terrane'></a>terrane
is diversified, patches of blue-green alternating with
stretches of reddish ochre. Of the two opaline tints
the reddish ochre predominates, fully five eighths of the
disk being occupied by it.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was early evident in the study of the surface
of Mars that its ochreish disk was not spotless.
Huyghens in 1659 saw the Syrtis Major. From this
first fruit of areography dates, indeed, the initial recognition
of the planet’s rotation; for on noting that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
the marking changed its place, he inferred a turning of
the planet upon itself in about twenty-four hours. Thirteen
years later he observed and drew it again and this
time in company with the polar cap. Again, after
eleven more years, he depicted it for the third time, and
now so changed because of the different tilt of the planet
toward the earth that it may be doubted whether Huyghens
himself recognized it for the same. But that
he drew it correctly a globe of Mars will at once show.</p>

<p class='c008' >From such small beginning did areography progress
to the perception of permanent patches of a sombre hue
distributed more or less irregularly over the disk. Impressing
the observers simply as dark at first, they later
came to be recognized as possessing color, a blue-green,
which contrasted beautifully with the reddish ochre
of the rest of the surface. Cassini, Maraldi, Bianchini,
Herschel, Schroeter, all saw markings which they reproduced.
Finally, with Beer and Maedler, came the
first attempt at a complete geography. In and out
through the ochre was traced the blue; commonly in
long Mediterraneans of shade, but here and there in
isolated Caspians of color. With our modern telescopic
means the dark patches are easily visible, the
very smallest glass sufficing to disclose them. When
thus shown they much resemble in contour the dark
patches on the face of the Moon as seen with the naked
eye. Now these patches were early taken for lunar
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
seas and received names in keeping with the conception;
as the Sea of Serenity, the Sea of Vapors, and so forth.
Following the recognition of a like appearance, like
appellatives were given to the Martian markings; and
the Mare Sirenum, or Sea of the Sirens, the Mare Cimmerium,
and others sufficiently proclaim what was
thought of them at the time they were thus baptized.
Indeed, if a general similarity be any warrant for a
generic name they were not at the time ill-termed.
For, common to all three bodies, the Earth, the Moon,
and the planet Mars, is the figuration of their surfaces
into light areas and dark. In the Martian disk, as in
the lunar one, we seem to be looking at a cartographic
presentation of some strange geography suspended in
the sky; the first generic difference between the two
being that the chart is done in chiaroscuro for the Moon,
in color for Mars. On mundane maps, we know the
dusky washes for oceans; so on the Moon it was only
natural to consider their counterparts as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i>; and
on Mars as ‘seas.’ Nor did the blue-green hue of the
Martian ones detract from the resemblance.</p>

<p class='c008' >But in something other than color these markings are
alike. In fact, color could hardly be excuse for considering
the lunar <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> what their name implies, for distinctive
tint is lacking in them, even to the naked eye.
It was in form that the likeness lay. Their figures
were such as our own oceans show; and allowing for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
a sisterly contrast amid a sisterly resemblance, the
lunar <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> or the Martian seas might well have been
of similar origin to those with which our schoolboy
study of atlases had made us familiar. Thus did similarity
in look suggest similarity in origin, and intuitive
recognition clothe its objects with the same specific
name.</p>

<p class='c008' >Considerable assumption, however, underlay the
pleasing simplicity of the correlation on other grounds,
consequent not so much upon any lack of astronomic
knowledge as, curiously, upon a dearth of knowledge of
ourselves. We know how other bodies look to us, but we
ignore how we look to them. It is not so easy to see
ourselves as others see us; for a far view may differ from
a near one, and a matter of inclination greatly alter
the result. Owing both to distance and to tilt we
lack that practical acquaintance with the aspect of our
own oceans viewed from above, necessary to definite
predication of their appearance across interplanetary
space. Our usual idea is that seas show dark, but it is
also quite evident that under some circumstances they
appear the contrary. It all depends upon the position
of the observer and upon the position of the Sun. Their
usual ultramarine may become even as molten brass
from indirect reflection; while on direct mirroring,
they give back the Sun with such scarce perceptible
purloining of splendor as to present a dazzling sheen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
not to be gazed upon without regret. Canopied by a
welkin they assume its leaden hue, while at the same
time, their shores, less impressionable to borrowed lighting,
show several tints darker than themselves. Surfaces
so sensitive to illumination hardly admit of more
accusable tint than a chameleon. Nevertheless, we are
probably justified in our conviction that perpendicularly
visaged, they would on the whole outdo in sombreness
land round about them, and so be evident as dusky
patches against a brighter ground.</p>

<p class='c008' >One phenomenon we might with some confidence look
to see exhibited by them were they oceans, and that is
the reflected image of the Sun visible as a burnished
glare at a calculable point. Specular reflection of the
sort was early suggested in the case of Mars, and physical
ephemerides for the planet registered for many years
the precise spot where the starlike image should be
sought. But it was never seen. Yet not till the marine
character of the Martian seas had been otherwise disproved
was the futile quest for it abandoned. Indeed,
it was a tacit recognition that our knowledge had advanced
when this column in the ephemeris was allowed
to lapse.</p>

<p class='c008' >On this general marine ascription doubt was first
cast in the case of the Moon. So soon as the telescope
came to be pointed at our satellite, it was evident that
the darker washes were not water surfaces at all, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
very palpably plains. Long low ridges of elevation
stood out upon them like prairie swells, which grew in
visible relief according to the slanting character of the
illumination. Cracks or rills, too, appeared near their
edges and craters showed in their very midst. Patently
solid they betrayed their constitution not only
by diverse topography but by diversified tint. All
manner of shades of neutral tone mottled their surface,
from seeming porphyry to chalk. Belief perforce departed
when the telescope thus pricked the bubble,
evaporating as the water itself had done long before.</p>

<p class='c008' >So much was known before the Mars’ markings were
named. Nevertheless, humanity, true to its instincts,
promptly proceeded to commit again the same mistake,
and, cheerfully undeterred by the exposure of its errors
in the case of the Moon, repeated the christening in the
case of Mars. So sure was it of its ground that what
it saw was not ground, that though the particular appellatives
of the several seas were constantly altered,
rebaptisms, while changing the personal, kept the generic
name. Dawes’ Ocean, for example, later became
l’Ocean Newton and later still the Mare Erythraeum,
but remained set down as much a sea as before. About
thirteen years ago, however, what had befallen the
seas of the Moon, befell those of Mars: the loss of
their character. It was first recognized through a
similar exposure; but the fact was led up to and might
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
have been realized in consequence of quite a different
line of evidence. The initial thing to cast doubt upon
the seas being what they seemed to be was the detection
of change in their aspect. That the detection was not
made much earlier than actually happened shows how
a phenomenon may elude observation if scrutiny be
not persistent, and its results from time to time not
carefully compared. Schiaparelli was the one who
first noticed variation in the look of the seas, and the
discovery was as much due to the assiduity with which
he followed the planet opposition after opposition as to
the keenness with which he scanned it. The noting of
change in the blue-green areas constituted, in fact, one
of the first fruits of systematic study of the planet.
Change in configuration, that is, alteration of area, preceded
in recognition alteration of tint. Thus the
Syrtis Major showed larger to him in 1879 than it had
in 1877. This was natural; difference of degree being
a more delicate matter to perceive than its effect upon
extent. From change of area his perception went on
to change of tone. In his own words, what he noticed
was this: <cite>Memoria</cite>, VI, 1888, “No less certain is it
that, from one opposition to another, one notices in the
seas, very remarkable alterations of tone. Thus the
regions called Mare Cimmerium, Mare Sirenum, and
Solis Lacus, which during the years 1877 to 1879 could
be numbered among the most sombre on the planet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
during the succeeding oppositions became less and less
black, and in 1888 were of a light gray hardly sufficient
to render them visible in the oblique position in which
all three found themselves.... On the other hand,
at the very same moment, the Mare Acidalium and the
Lacus Hyperboreus showed very dark; the latter indeed
appeared nearly black, although seen as tilted as
the Syrtis and the equatorial bays. The condition of the
regions called seas is therefore not constant: so much
is unquestionable. Perhaps the change produced in
them has to do with the season of the planet’s year.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Holding as he did the then prevailing view that the
blue-green regions were bodies of water, he regarded
those of intermediate tint as vast marshes or swamps,
and he accounted for change of hue in them as due to
inundations and occasions of drying up. In consequence
of losing their water, the seas, he thought,
had in places become so shallow that the bottom
showed through.</p>

<p class='c008' >Plausible on the surface, this theory breaks down so
soon as it is subjected to quantitative criticism. For
the moment we try to track the water, we detect the
inadequacy of the clew. The enormous areas over
which the phenomenon occurs necessitates the establishing
an alibi for all the lost water that has gone.
Drying up on such a scale would mean the removal
of many feet of liquid over hundreds of thousands of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
miles in extent. To produce any such change in appearance
as we witness, even on the supposition that
these seas were none too deep to start with, would involve
lowering the level of the water by from five to
twenty feet throughout two thirds of the whole surface
of the southern hemisphere. This would leave a
heap of waters to be accounted for, bewildering in its
immensity. The myriad tons of it must be disposed of;
either by drainage into other regions or by being caught
up into the sky.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this emergency it might seem at first as if the polar
cap of the opposite hemisphere offered itself as a possible
reservoir for the momentarily superfluous fluid. But
such hoped-for outlet to the problem is at once closed
by the simple fact that when the lightening of the dark
regions of the southern hemisphere takes place, the
opposite polar cap has already attained its maximum;
in fact, has already begun to melt. It, therefore, absolutely
refuses to lend itself to any such service. This
was not known to Schiaparelli’s time, the observations
which have established it, by recording more completely
the history of the cap, having since been made. Indeed,
it was not known even at the time when the writer,
in 1894, showed the impossibility of the transfer on other
grounds; to wit, on the fact of no commensurate concomitant
darkening of the surface elsewhere and on the
manifest non-complicity, if not impotency, of the Martian
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
atmosphere in the process. The transference of
the water to other dark patches in the northern hemisphere
fails of sufficiency of explanation because of
the limited extent of such areas on that side of the
globe; while the air is quite as incapable of carrying
away any such body of liquid, though the whole of it
were at the saturation-point, not to mention that there
exists no sign of the attempt. The reader will find
this reasoning set forth in <cite>Mars</cite>, published eleven
years ago. He will now note, from what has been said
above about the northern polar cap, that continued
observations since have resulted in opening up another
line of proof which has only strengthened the conclusion
there reached.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de grâce</span></i>, however, to the old belief was
given when the surface of the dark areas was found
to be traversed by permanent
lines by Pickering
and Douglass. Continued
observation showed these
lines to be unchangeable in
place. Now permanent
lines cannot exist on bodies
of water, and in consequence
the idea that what
we looked on there were water surfaces had to be
abandoned.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
Thus we now know that the markings on both the
Moon and Mars which have been called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> are not
in reality seas. Yet we shall do well still to keep the
old-fashioned sonorous names, Mare Erythraeum, Mare
Sirenum, and their fellows, because it is inconvenient
to change; while, if we please, we may see in their consecrated
Latin couching the fit embalming in a dead
language of a conception that itself is dead.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Since closer acquaintance takes from the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i>
their character of seas, we are led to inquire again
into their constitution. Now, when we set ourselves
to consider to what such appearances could be due we
note something besides sea, which forms a large part
of our earth’s surface, and would have very much
what we suppose the latter’s aspect from afar to
be, not only in tone, but in tint. This something is
vegetation. Seen from a height and mellowed by
atmospheric distance, great forests lose their green to
become themselves ultramarine.</p>

<p class='c008' >To dispossess a previous conception is difficult, but
so soon as we have put the idea of seas out of our heads
a vegetal explanation proves to satisfy the phenomena,
even at first glance, better than water surfaces. In
their color, blue-green, the dark areas exactly typify
the distant look of our own forests; whereas we are
not at all sure that seas would. From color alone we
are more justified in deeming them vegetal than marine.
But the moment we go farther into the matter the
more certain we become of being upon the right road.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
With increased detection the markings they reveal and
the metamorphoses they undergo, while pointing away
from water, point as directly to vegetation. All the
inexplicabilities which the supposition of water involves
find instant solution on the theory of vegetal
growth. The non-balancing of the areas of shading
in their shift from one part of the disk to another, no
longer becomes a circumstance impossible to explain,
but a necessary consequence of their new-found character,
denoting the time necessary for vegetation to
sprout. The change of hue of vast areas from blue-green
to ochre no longer presupposes the bodily transference
of thousands of tons of substance, but the quiet
turning of the leaf under autumnal frosts. Even the
fact that they occupy those regions most fitted by figure
to contain oceans fits in with the same conception.
For that the Martian equivalents of forest and moorland,
tree and grass, should grow now in the lowest
parts of the planet’s surface is what might not unreasonably
be expected from the very fact of their being
low, since what remained of the water would tend
both on the surface and in the air to drain into them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008' >For the change in question to be vegetal it must occur
at the proper season of the planet’s year. This we must
now consider. We have said that Schiaparelli detected
change in the blue-green regions and suspected
this change of seasonal affiliation. He inferred this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
from piecing together the aspects of different seasons
of different years as shown in consecutive Martian oppositions.
To mark it actually take place in a single Martian
year came later. In 1894, at Flagstaff, the southern
hemisphere was presented during its late spring
and early summer; it was observed, too, for many of
our months in succession. During this time the planet
was specially well circumstanced for study of the
change in that hemisphere, both by reason of the appositeness
of the season and of the unusual size of the
disk. Advantage was taken of the double event to
a recording of the consecutive appearances certain
regions underwent, and the contrasted states thus exhibited
were such as clearly to betoken the action of
seasonal change. What Schiaparelli had thus ably
inferred from diverse portions of different Martian
years was in this case shown occurring in one and the
same semestral cycle.</p>

<p class='c008' >Usually the change of hue seems essentially one of
tone; the blue-green fades out, getting less and less
pronounced, until in extreme cases only ochre is left
behind. It acts as if the darker color were superimposed
upon the lighter and could be to a greater or less
extent removed. This is what Schiaparelli noted and
what was seen in 1894 at Flagstaff. Three views <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
suite</span></i> of the chain of changes then observed are shown
in <cite>Mars</cite>, the region known as Hesperia being central
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
in each. Comparison of the three discloses a remarkable
metamorphosis in that “promontory,” a rise into
visibility by a paling of its complexion. Nor is the
contrast confined to it; changes as salient will be
noticed in the pictures over the other parts of the disk.</p>

<p class='c008' >There have been instances, however, of a metamorphosis
so much more strange as to deserve exposition
in detail; one where not tone simply is involved, but
where a quite new tint has surprisingly appeared.</p>

<p>Mare Erythræum<br />Martian date. January 16</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >On April 19, 1903, when, after being hidden for
thirty days, owing to the different rotation periods of the
two planets, the Mare Erythraeum, the largest blue-green
region of the disk and lying in the southern hemisphere,
rounded again into view, a startling transformation
stood revealed in it. Instead of showing blue-green
as usual, and as it had done six weeks before, it
was now of a distinct chocolate-brown. It had been
well seen at its previous presentation, so that no doubt
existed of its then tint. At that time the Martian season
corresponded to December 30 in our calendar.
Eighteen Martian days had since elapsed, and it was
now January 16 there. The metamorphosis had taken
place, therefore, shortly after the winter solstice of that
part of the planet. The color change that had supervened
proved permanent. For the next night the
region showed the same brown hue, and so it continued
to appear throughout the days that it was visible.

pale at the south. It had come to be February

<p class='c008' >At the next opposition, in 1905, a recurrence of the
transformation was watched for, and not in vain. It
occurred, however, somewhat later in the Martian season.
On December 27 of the planet’s current year the
Mare Erythraeum was still as usual, blue-green, nothing
out of the ordinary being remarked in it; and so it was
on its January 17, although the southern edge was darker
than the northern. It looked certainly as if the metamorphosis
were this year to be omitted. But such
was not the case. When the region again came round,
on February 1 of the Martian calendar, there the strange
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
tint was as unmistakable as it had been on its original
occurrence. Not only was the Mare Erythraeum so
colored, but on February 5 (Martian) the northern portion
of the Mare Cimmerium was observed to be similarly
affected. In the Mare Erythraeum the anomalous
chocolate hue was confined to a belt between the latitudes
of 10° and 20° south of the equator; in the Mare
Cimmerium it stretched a little higher, from 10° at the
west to 25° at the east. It is noteworthy that the
southern portion of the latter showed blue at the time
the northern showed brown. Then the metamorphosis
proceeded as shown in the following table:—</p>

When we consider the vegetal-like blue-green that it

can hardly resist the conclusion that it was something
very like fallow field that was there uncovered to our

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
That it is seasonal can scarcely be doubted from the
timeliness of its occurrence, and that different portions
of its terrane successively underwent their metamorphosis
shows further that it followed a law peculiar
to the planet, to which we shall be introduced when we
come to consider the phenomena of the canals.</p>

<p class='c008' >Instances of relative hue in different dark patches
corroboratory of seasonal variation, and therefore of
vegetal constitution, might easily be adduced. Thus,
in 1905 during the summer of the northern hemisphere,
the Mare Acidalium was notably darker than the Mare
Erythraeum to the north of it, which is what the law
of seasonal variation would require, since it was June
in the one, December in the other at the time. But we
need not to add example to example or proof to proof,
for there are no phenomena that contradict it. We
conclude, therefore, that the blue-green areas of Mars
are not seas, but areas of vegetation. Just as reasoning
to a negative result drifts us to the first conclusion, so
reasoning to a positive one lands us at the second.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >With the vanishing of its seas we get for the first
time solid ground on which to build our Martian
physiography. The change in <i>venue</i> from oceans to
land has produced a complete alteration in our judgment
of the present state of the planet. It destroys
the analogy which was supposed to exist between Mars
and our earth, and by abolishing the actuality of oceans
there, seems, metaphorically, to put us at first all the
more at sea in our attempt to understand the planet.
But looked at more carefully, it turns out to explain
much that was obscure, and in so doing gives us at once
a wider view of the history of planetary evolution.</p>

<p class='c008' >The trait concerned is cosmic. Study of the several
planets of our solar system, notably the Earth, Moon,
and Mars, reveals tolerably legibly an interesting phase
of a planet’s career, which apparently must happen
to all such bodies, and evidently has happened or is
happening to these three: the transition of its surface
from a terraqueous to a purely terrestrial condition.
The terraqueous state is well exhibited by
our own earth at the moment, where lands and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
oceans share the surface between them. The terrestrial
is exemplified by both the Moon and Mars,
on whose surfaces no bodies of water at present exist.
That the one state passes by process of development
into the other I shall now give my reasons for
believing.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the first place the appearance of the dark markings
both on the Moon and Mars hints that though seas
no longer, they were seas once upon a time. On the
moon, not only does their shape suggest this previous
condition, but the smooth and even look of their surfaces
adds to the cogency of the inference. More important,
however, than either of these characteristics,
and confirmatory of both, is the fact that the great
tracts in question seem to lie below the level of the corrugated
surface, which is thickly strewn with volcanic
cones. Their level and their levelness fay in explanation
into one another. The first makes possible the
former presence of water; the second speaks of its
effect. For their flat character hints that these areas
were held down at the time when the other parts of
the surface were being violently thrown up. That
they can themselves be cooled lava flows, their extent
and position seem enough to negative; to say nothing
of the fact that they should in that case lie above,
not below, the general level. Something, therefore,
covered them during the moon’s eruptive youth and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
disappeared later. Such superincumbence may well
have been water, under which the now great plains lay
then as ocean bottoms. Deep-sea soundings in our
own oceans betray an ocean floor of the same extensive
sort, diversified as on the moon. To call the
lunar <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> seas may not be so complete a misnomer
after all; but only a resurrecting in epitaph what was
the truth in its day.</p>

<p class='c008' >Only doubtfully offered here for the Moon, for
Mars the inference seems more sure. Here again the
dark regions not only look as they should had they
had an earlier history, but they, too, seem to lie below
the level of the surface round about. When they pass
over the terminator they invariably show as flattenings
upon it, as if a slice of the surface had been pared
off. Such profile in such pass is what ground at a
lower level would present. Undoubtedly a part of the
seeming depression is due to relative absence of irradiation
consequent upon a more sombre tint, but loss
of light hardly seems capable of the whole effect. In
the case of Mars, then, as with the Moon, a mistaken
inference builded better than it knew, if, indeed, we
should rightly consider an inference to be mistaken
which on half data lands us at the right door.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the aspects of the dark regions we are led,
then, to regard Mars as having passed through that stage
of existence in which the earth finds itself at the moment,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
the stage at which oceans and seas form a feature
of its landscape and an impediment to subjugation of
its surface in its entirety. What once were ocean beds
have become ocean bottoms devoid of that which
originally filled them.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the process of parting with a watery envelop
is an inevitable concomitant of the evolution of a planet
from chaos to world, we do not have to go so far afield
as Mars and the Moon for testimony. Scrutiny reveals
as much in the history of our own globe. Two signposts
of the past, one geologic, the other paleontologic,
point unmistakably in this direction. The
geologic guides us the more directly to the goal.</p>

<p class='c008' >Study of the earth’s surface reveals the preponderating
encroachment of the land upon the sea since both
began to be, and demonstrates that, except for local
losses, the oceans have been contracting in size from
archaic times. So much is evidenced by the successive
places upon which marine beds have been laid down.
This suggests itself at once as a theoretic probability
to one considering the matter from a cosmic standpoint,
and it is therefore the more interesting and conclusive
that, from an entirely different departure-point, it
should have been one of the pet propositions of the
late Professor Dana, who worked out conclusively the
problem for North America, and published charts
detailing the progressive making of that continent.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
So telling is this reclaiming by nature of land from
the sea that it will be well to follow Dana a little into
detail, as the details show effectively the continuity of
the process acting through æons of geologic time. At
the beginning of the Archæan age, or, in other words,
at the epoch when stratified beds were first laid down,
the earth reached a turning-point in its history.
Erosion, superficial and sub-aërial, then set in to help
restrict the domain of the sea. At this juncture North
America consisted of a sickle of terrane inclosing Hudson’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
Bay and coming down at its apex to a point not
much removed from where Ottawa now stands, in
about latitude 45°—a Labradorian North America
only. This, the kernel of the future continent, curiously
symbolized the form that continent was later to
take. For its eastern edge was roughly parallel to the
present Atlantic coastline, although much within and
to the north of it, while its western one was similarly
aligned afar off to the now Pacific slope. Besides this
continent proper, the Appalachian, Rocky Mountain,
Sierra Nevada, and Sierra Madre chains stood out of the
ocean in long, narrow ridges of detached land, outlining
in skeleton the bones of the continent that was to be.
The Black Hills of Dakota and other highlands made
here and there islets in the sea.</p>

<p class='c008' >Much the same backbone-showing of continents yet
to be filled out was true of Europe, Asia, and South
America. In Europe the northern countries constituted
all that could be called continental land. Most of
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Lapland, existed then, while
the northern half of Scotland, the outer Hebrides, portions
of Ireland, England, France, and Germany stood
out as detached islands. From this, which is a fair
sample of the proportion of land then to land now over
the other continents so far as they are geologically
known, we turn to consider more in detail the history
of North America.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
By the time the Upper Silurian period came in, the
Appalachian highlands there had been greatly extended
and joined to the Labradorian mainland by continuous
territory; otherwise, no important addition had occurred,
though islands emerged in Ohio, Kentucky, and
Missouri.</p>

<p class='c008' >At the commencement of the Carbonic era what are

north, and Newfoundland, from a small island in the

Labrador, while the Eastern states region and Nova
Scotia had risen into being. The movements closing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
Paleozoic time upheaved from low islands the Appalachian
chain. The earth’s crust here crumpled
by contraction upon itself; and the movement ended,
as Dana says, by making dry land of the whole eastern
half of the continent, along substantially its present
lines.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mesozoic time was the period of the making of the
West. It was an era of deposition and coincident subsidence,
when the western land had its nose just above
water at one moment to be submerged the next.
Though on the whole this part of the continent was
emerging, the fact was that, synchronously with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
sinking of the sea, much of the land from time to time
sank too. The contraction which raised the Appalachian
Mountains at the beginning of the period and that
of the Rockies at its close overdid the necessities of the
case and caused subsidence elsewhere. The southeastern
portion of the continent suffered most, the West
on the whole materially gaining. In the Triassic and
Jurassic eras the gain was pronounced; it occurred in
the Cretaceous also, but with much alternation of loss.
Finally, at the close of the Cretaceous, the continent,
except for a prolonged Gulf of Mexico and vast internal
lakes, was substantially complete.</p>

<p class='c008' >The filling up of these lakes and the reclaiming of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
land from the Gulf of Mexico constituted the land-making
work of Tertiary times. The extent of the
lakes in the Eocene era is held to show that the general
level of the mountain plateau was low and rose later.
So that the gain by the land at this time was greater
than the map allows to appear. By the beginning of
the Quaternary epoch the continents had assumed
their present general area, and since then their internal
features have alone suffered change.</p>

<p class='c008' >A similar rising from the sea fell to the lot of Europe,
though it has not been detailed with so much care. The
skeleton of that continent was at the beginning of
depositary time much what it is to-day, but a great inland
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
sea occupied the centre of it, which, as time went
on, was gradually silted in and evaporated away,
notably during the Upper Silurian period.</p>

<p class='c008' >From all this it is pretty clear that, side by side with
alternating risings and sinkings of the land, there was
a tolerably steady gain in the contest by which dry
ground dispossessed the sea. We may, of course,
credit this to a general deepening of the ocean bottoms
due to crumpling of the crust, but we may also impute
it to a loss of water, and that the latter is, at least for
a part, in the explanation the condition of the Moon
and Mars makes probable.</p>

<p class='c008' >Paleontology has the same story of reclamation to
tell as geology, and with as much certainty, though its
evidence is circumstantial instead of direct and speaks
for the growing importance of the land in the globe’s
economy since the beginning of depositary time, and
thus inferentially to its increasing extent. Fossil
remains of the plants and creatures that have one after
the other inhabited the earth show that the land has
been steadily rising both in floral and faunal estimation
as a habitat from the earliest ages to the present day.
The record lies imprinted in the strata consecutively
laid down, and except for gaps reads as directly on in
bettering domicile as in evolutionary development.</p>

<p class='c008' >In Archæan times we find no undisputed evidence
of life either vegetal or animal. But beds of graphite
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
and of limestone point to the possible existence of both.
Even anthracite has been found in Archæan rocks in
Norway and also in Rhode Island. Whether Dawson’s
Eozoon Canadense be a rhizopod or a crystal, doctors
of science disagree. Dana, while admitting nothing
specific, deems it antecedently probable that algæ
and later microscopic fungi related to bacteria existed
then, living in water well up toward the boiling-point.
Indeed, it is practically certain that invertebrate life
existed, because of its already well-developed character
in the next era. The like antedating is inferable for
the whole record of the rocks. Relatively their history
is undoubtedly fairly accurate, but absolutely it must
be shifted bodily backward into the next preceding era
to correspond with fact not yet unearthed.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the Lower Cambrian, when first the existence of
life becomes a certainty, that life, so far as known, was
wholly invertebrate and wholly marine; rhizopods
(probably), sponges and corals, echinoderms, worms,
brachiopods, mollusks, and crustaceans grew amid
primitive seaweed and have left their houses in the shape
of shells while perishing themselves. Their tracks
too have thus survived. The trilobites, crustaceans
somewhat resembling our horseshoe crab, were the
lords of the Cambrian seas and marked the point to
which organic evolution had then attained. Their
aquatic character as well as their simple type is shown
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
by their thoracic legs having each a natatory appendage.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the next era, the Lower Silurian, the fauna and
flora were still marine, although of a higher order than
before, and in the Trenton period, the upper part of the
era, the earliest vertebrates, fishes, come upon the scene:
ganoids and possibly sharks. Nothing terrestrial of
this period has yet with certainty been unearthed in
America. Europe would seem to have either been more
advanced then or better studied since, for there the
first plant higher than a seaweed has been dug up, one
of a fresh-water genus betokening the land; while in
keeping with this the first insect, an hemipter, also has
been disinterred. Both the geography and the life of
the Eopaleozoic period Dana styles “thalassic.”</p>

<p class='c008' >Neopaleozoic time, beginning with the Upper Silurian,
marked the emergence of the continents, and following
them the emergence of life from the water on to
this land. In the lower beds of the Upper Silurian in
America we find only the aquatic forms of previous
strata, but in a higher one we come in marshes upon
plants related to the equiseta or horsetails. In
England land plants appear for the first time in these
latest Silurian beds and in the schists of Angers have
been preserved ferns. In both the old world and the
new fossil fishes are found and the oldest terrestrial
species of scorpions. But the great bulk of forms was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
still marine; corals, crinoids, brachiopods, trilobites
constituting the principal inhabitants. At this time
the seas were warm, having much the same temperature
between 65° and 80° north as between 30° and 45°;
the prevalence of a general temperate tropicality being
shown by the fact that the common tropical chain
corals lived in latitude 82° north.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the Devonian era, the Old Red Sandstone, fishes
grew and multiplied, increasing in size apparently
through the era, and in the last period of it reaching
their culminating point. These pelagic vertebrates
much surpassed in structure the terrestrial population
of the time, which was of a low type and consisted of
invertebrates such as myriapods, spiders, scorpions,
and insects; for the land was only making. In the
mid-Devonian, forests of a primitive kind covered such
country as there was, an amphibious land, composed
of jungles and widespread marshes. Tree ferns made
the bulk of the vegetation, but among them grew also
cycads and yews. Mammoth may-flies flitted through
the gloom of these old forests, but no vertebrate as yet
had left the sea.</p>

<p class='c008' >Following upon the Old Red Sandstone were laid
down the Carbonic strata, and with the Carbonic entered
upon the scene the advance scouts of an army
of progress evolutionarily impelled to spy out the land—the
first amphibians. They made their début in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
Subcarboniferous section of the era, the oldest of the
three periods into which the Carbonic is divided,
crawling out of the sea to return again and leaving but
footprints at first on the sands of time. In the second
period, the Coal-measures proper, they ventured so far
as to leave their skeletons on terra firma, or rather
infirma, while their tracks there show them to have
been now in great numbers. In this manner the ancestors
of the oldest land inhabitants began to struggle
out of the sea. In the Permian, the third and latest
period of paleozoic times, we find their descendants
established in their new habitat, for in it we come upon
the first reptiles. Such possession marks a distinct
step up in function as in fact, for while amphibians
visited dry land, reptiles made it their home. The
getting out of the water had now, in the case of the
more evolved forms, become an accomplished fact.
The reptiles were, indeed, the lowest and most generalized
of their class, Rhynchocephalians, “beak-headed”
species that by their teeth proclaim their marine
origin and their relationship to the great amphibians
that still felt undecided where to stay. Meanwhile,
in Europe dragon-flies, two feet across, possessed the
air; while amphibians there, as here, ancestrally preceded
reptiles in occupying the land.</p>

<p class='c008' >Mesozoic times were, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</span></i>, the age of monsters;
for the Triassic (the New Red Sandstone),
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
Jurassic and Cretaceous eras marked the reign of the
reptiles. Great dinosaurs sleep still in the Triassic
strata of the Atlantic border and in the Jurassic of the
Western states, to be unearthed from time to time
and be given mausolea in our museums. Gigantic
they were and very literally possessed the earth. In
Europe they were substantially as in America during
these mesozoic eras, and showed their dominance by
long survival in time as well as world-wide distribution
in space; for they lived all the way from Kansas to
New Zealand and from the Trias to the Upper Cretaceous.
It is supposed by Professor Osborn that many
of them, like the herbivorous brontosaurus, waded in
marshes, not wholly unlike in habit to the modern
hippopotamus. Others were land-stalking carnivores,
like the megalosaurs of a little later date. Of enormous
size, the largest exceeded any animal which has ever
lived, the whales alone excepted; the biggest, the
atlantosaurus and the brontosaurus, reaching a length
of sixty feet. For all their bulk they had scant brains,
just enough to enable them to feed and wallow, probably.
It is interesting to note that many of the reptiles,
the less adventurous, apparently reverted to the
sea. For though the crocodilians existed already in
the Trias, the plesiosaurians did not come in till the
Middle Trias in Europe, and the sea-serpents (mosasaurus)
till the Upper Cretaceous.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
Though the dinosaurs dominated life in those days,
higher forms, their descendants, unnoticed were gradually
creeping in, eventually to supplant them. For
brain was making its way unobtrusively in the earliest
of the mammals, diminutive creatures at first and of the
lowest type. First appearing in the Trias as something
approaching the missing link between reptiles
and mammals, they later developed into monotremes
and marsupials, not rising in differentiation above the
latter order to the end of Mesozoic times. And this
both in the old world and the new. In the Jurassic, too,
flying lizards and the first birds appeared, showing
their pedigree in their teeth.</p>

<p class='c008' >With Cenozoic times we come upon the first true or
placental mammals with their culmination up to date
in man. In the Eocene they were of a primitive type;
they were also of a comprehensive one, fitted to eat anything.
From this they specialized, some evolving and
some on the whole devolving; the whale, for instance,
taking to the water in the Eocene through the same
degenerate proclivity that had characterized the sea-saurians
ages before. The earth was growing colder,
though still fairly warm, and with the fall in temperature
the higher types of life antithetically rose, evolution
gradually fitting them to cope with more advanced
conditions. In this manner did the land supplant the
sea as the essential feature of the earth’s surface, first,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
in coming into being, and then, by offering conditions
fraught with greater possibilities, as the habitat of the
most advanced forms of life, both plants and animals.</p>

<p class='c008' >The possibility of advance in evolution was largely
due to the fact that the land did thus supplant the sea.
Spontaneous variation, the as yet unexplained <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum
mobile</span></i> in the genesis of species, is probably to be
referred to chemism and is likely later to receive its
solution at the hands of that science. In the meanwhile
it is evident that unless the variation obtain encouragement
from the environment no advance in type occurs.
Now the land offers to an organism sufficiently evolved
to benefit by it, opportunities the sea does not possess.
First of these, undoubtedly, is the care it enables to be
given to the young. To cast one’s brood upon the
waters is not the best method of insuring its bringing up.
There is too much of the uncertainties of wave and current
to make the process a healthy one, and even when
attached to rocks and seaweed, the attachment to a
mother is to be preferred. Without a period of infancy,
when the young is unable to do for itself, no great
development is possible. In the only striking exception,
the case of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises,
size has probably counted for much in the matter, while
the development of the cetaceans is far behind that
of the majority of land mammals.</p>

<p class='c008' >Change of place, not in distance, but in variety, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
another factor. The sea is same as a habitat, one square
mile of it being much like another, except for gradually
changing temperature. The land, on the other hand,
from its accidented surface, presents all manner of
diversity in the conditions. And the more varied the
conditions to which the organism is exposed, the greater
its own complexity must be to enable it to meet them.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the terrestrial stage of planetary development
is subsequent to the terraqueous one, and must of
necessity succeed it if the latter ever exist on a body,
follows from the loss of internal heat on the one hand
and from the kinetic theory of gases on the other. To
which of the two to attribute the lion’s share in the
business is matter for doubt; but that both must be
concerned in it we may take for certain.</p>

<p class='c008' >So long as the internal heat suffices to keep the body
fluid, the liquid itself sees to it that all interstices are
filled. As the heat dissipates, the body begins to solidify,
starting with the crust. For cosmic purposes it undoubtedly
still remains plastic, but cracks of relatively
small size are both formed and persist. Into these the
surface water seeps. With continued refrigeration the
crust thickens, more cracks are opened and more water
given lodgment within, to the impoverishment of the
seas. The process would continue till the pressure of
the crust itself rendered plastic all that lay below, beyond
which, of course, no fissures could be formed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
How competent to swallow all the seas such earth cuticle
cracks may be we ignore; for we cannot be said to
know much of the process. We can only infer that to
a certain extent internal absorption of surface seas
must mark a stage of the evolution by which a star
becomes a world and then an inert mass, one of the
dark bodies of which space is full.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of the other means we know more. We are certain
that it must take place, though we are in doubt as to
the amount it has already accomplished. This method
of depletion is by the departure of the water in the form
of gas, in consequence of the molecular motions. If we
knew the temperature and the age of Mars and also
the amount of atmosphere originally surrounding it,
we could possibly predicate its state. Reversely, we
can infer something as to age and temperature from
its present condition.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_7 c015'     >Both for their evidence and their extent the great
ochre stretches of the disk claim attention first.
Largely unchangeable, these show essentially the same
day after day and from the year’s beginning to its end.
In hue they range from sand color to a brick red; some
parts of the planet being given to the one tint, some
to the other. It is to the latter that the fiery tint of
Mars to the naked eye is due. The differences in complexion
are local and peculiar, both in place and time.
For though saffron best paints the greater part of the
light areas, certain localities present at times a red
like that of our red sandstone. Hellas is one of these
ruddy regions and Aeria another. It is only on occasion
that they thus show, and to what to assign their variability
is as yet matter of conjecture. Possibly it is
owing to Martian meteorologic condition; possibly
to something else. But whatever its origin, the change
is not so much contradictory of, as supplementary to,
the general fact of unalterableness, which is after all
the basic trait about them and the keynote to their
condition.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
Land the ochre regions have generally been taken for,
and land they still make good their claim to be considered.
For the better they are seen, the greater the
ground for the belief. Indeed, they seem to be nothing
but ground, or, in other words, deserts. Their
color first points them out for such. The pale salmon
hue, which best reproduces in drawings the general
tint of their surface, is that which our own deserts wear.
The Sahara has this look; still more it finds its counterpart
in the far aspect of the Painted Desert of
northern Arizona. To one standing on the summit of
the San Francisco Peaks and gazing off from that isolated
height upon this other isolation of aridity, the
resemblance of its lambent saffron to the telescopic
tints of the Martian globe is strikingly impressive.
Far forest and still farther desert are transmuted by
distance into mere washes of color, the one robin’s-egg
blue, the other roseate ochre, and so bathed, both, in
the flood of sunshine from out a cloudless burnished
sky that their tints rival those of a fire-opal. None
otherwise do the Martian colors stand out upon the
disk at the far end of the journey down the telescope’s
tube. Even in its mottlings the one expanse recalls
the other. To the Painted Desert its predominating
tint is given by the new red sandstone of the Trias,
the stratum here exposed; and this shows in all its
pristine nakedness because of the lack of water to clothe
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
it with any but the sparsest growth. Limestones that
crop out beside it are lighter yellow, whitish and steel-gray,
and seen near give the terrane the look of a
painter’s palette. Seen from far they have rather the
tint of sand; and the one effect, like the other, is Martian
in look. And as if to assimilate the two planetary
appearances the more, the thread of blue-green that
attention traces athwart the Painted Desert marks
the line of cottonwoods along the banks of the Little
Colorado River—deserts both, if look be any guarantee
of character, with verdure banding them.</p>

<p class='c008' >In other ways these earthly deserts offer a parallel
to the Martian. No desert on the Earth is absolutely
devoid of life of some kind, vegetal and animal. The
worst conditioned are not what one is taught in childhood
to believe a desert to be—a vast waste of sand,
with a camel and a palm thrown in to heighten the
sterility. In all Saharas outside of the pages of the
school books some vegetation grows, though it is commonly
not of a kind to boast of, being rather a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">succés
d’estime</span></i>, as sagebrush, cacti, and the like. But what
is of interest here in the connection is its color. For
it is commonly of a more ochreish tint than usual, in
keeping with its surroundings, a paling out of the green
to something more tawny, indicating a relative reduction
of the chlorophyll and an increase of the lipochromes
in the tissues of the plant, since the one gives
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
the green tint to the leaves, the other the yellow. As
this vegetation, poor as it is, has its annual history,
it must alter the look of the desert at times and produce
precisely those slight variations in tint observable
on Mars in like circumstance.</p>

<p class='c008' >The Arizona desert dates from no further back than
early Tertiary times, as the limestone of the Cretaceous
there present shows. Water then stretched where
desert now is, and the limestone beds were laid down in
it. How old the Martian Saharas are we have no means
of knowing. But one thing we may predicate about
both: a desert is not an original, but an acquired, condition
of a planet’s surface, demonstrably so in the case
of a planet which has had a sedimentary epoch in its
life-history. In the Arizona desert the surface is composed
of depositary rocks of Mesozoic times, except
where lava streams have flowed down over it since
then. The land, then, was once under water, and
cannot but have been fertile for some time after it
emerged.</p>

<p class='c008' >But we are not left to inference in the matter, however
good that inference may be. A little to the south
of the Painted Desert, in the midst of the barren plateau
of northern Arizona, of which the former makes a part,
stand the remains of a petrified forest. Huge chalcedony
trunks of trees, so savingly transmuted into stone
that their genus is still decipherable, lie scattered here
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
over the barren ground in waste profusion, one of them
still spanning a cañon just as it fell in that, to it, destructive
day of a far prehistoric past. The rock
stratum on which their remains lie is of Triassic and
Cretaceous times and the petrifications show that in
the Cretaceous a stately forest overspread the land.
In those days at least the spot was fertile where now
sparse sagebrush and cacti find a living hard. Not here
alone where the blocks are so conspicuous as to invite
their carrying away is a former flourishing growth of
vegetation attested, but over large adjoining areas of
desert search has brought the like past tenancy to light.
Fragments of what once were trees have been picked
up in the Little Colorado basin and in the neighborhood
of Ash Fork, on both sides, that is, of the present
forest crown that covers the higher part of the plateau
from which rise the San Francisco Peaks. In the blue
distance the mountains look down verdure-clad upon
a now encircling waste, but one which in earlier eras
was as pine-bearing as they. Their lofty oasis is all
that is now left of a once fertile country; the retreat
of the trees up the slopes in consequence of a diminishing
rainfall, until a rise of two thousand feet from
what once was timber-land is necessary to reach the
tree-line of today, being typical of desert lands, and
testifying to greater aqueous affluence in the past.
In the same manner streams descend from the cedar-clad
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
range of the Lebanon to lose themselves in the
Arabian desert just without the doors of Damascus;
and Palestine has desiccated within history times.
Palestine, a land once flowing with milk and honey,
can hardly flow poor water now, and furnishes another
straw to mark the ebbing of the water supply.</p>

<p class='c008' >This making of deserts is not a sporadic, accidental,
or local matter, although local causes have abetted or
hindered it. On the contrary, it is an inevitable result
of planetary evolution, a phase of that evolution which
follows from what has been said in Chapter XII on
the abandonment of a planet by its water. Deserts
are simply another sign of the same process. The very
aging which began by depriving a body of its seas
takes from it later its forest and its grass. A growing
scarcity of water is bound to depauperate the one, as it
depletes the other. We have positive proof of the
action in our own deserts. For these bear testimony,
in places at least, to not having always been so, but
to have gradually become so within relatively recent
times. But we have more general proof of the action
from the position occupied on the earth’s surface by its
deserts.</p>

<p class='c008' >The significant fact about the desert-making so
stealthily going on is that only certain zones of the
earth’s surface are affected. Those belting the two
tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, for several degrees
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
on either side of them, most exhibit the phenomenon.
Such positioning of the deserts is not due to chance.
Directly, of course, desertism is due to dearth of rain.
This in turn depends on the character and condition
of the winds. If a wind laden with moisture travel
into a colder region of the globe, its moisture is precipitated
in rain and we have a fertile country; if it
voyage into a warmer clime it takes up what little
moisture may be there already and a desert is the
result.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now our system of winds is such as to produce a fall
of rain for the different latitudes, as tabulated by
Supan, thus:—</p>

<p class='c027' >Zones II and VI, the zones of minimum rainfall, are
also those in which the deserts occur. The northern
one traverses southern California, Arizona, New Mexico,
the Sahara, Arabia, and the Desert of Gobi; the southern,
Peru, the South African veldt, and central Australia.
The belts are wavy bands which by their
form betray both a general underlying trend to drought
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
at these parallels and also the effect of local topography
in the matter.</p>

<p class='c008' >From being distributed thus in belts, it is evident that
the deserts are general globe phenomena, and from their
being found only in the zones of least rainfall, that the
earth has itself entered, though not far as yet, upon
the desert stage of its history. Once begun, the desert
areas must perforce spread as water becomes scarce,
invading and occupying territory in proportion as the
rainfall there grows small.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now the axial tilt of Mars is almost exactly the same
as that of our Earth, the latest determinations from
the ensemble of measures giving 24° for it. Here, then,
we have initial conditions reproducing those of the
earth. But from the smaller size of the planet that
body would age the earlier, since it would lose its internal
heat the more rapidly, just as a small stone cools
sooner than a larger one. On general principles,
therefore, it should now be more advanced in its planetary
career. In consequence, desertism should have
overtaken more of its surface than has yet happened
on earth, and instead of narrow belts of sterility we
should expect to find there Saharas of relatively vast
extent.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, such a state of things is precisely what the
telescope reveals. The ochre tracts occupy nine tenths
of the northern hemisphere and a third of the southern.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
Three fifths, therefore, of the whole surface of the
planet is a desert.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of cosmic as well as of particular import is the correlation
thus made evident between the physical principles
that effect the aging of a planet and the aspect
Mars presents. Experimental corroboration of those
laws is thus afforded, while, reversely, confidence in
their applicability is increased. With continued observation
the planet appears more desiccate as improved
conditions bring it nearer. Dry land as it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
was thought to be proves even drier, something which
lacks water for the ordinary necessities of a living
world.</p>

<p class='c008' >The picture the planet offers to us is thus arid beyond
present analogue on Earth. Pitiless as our deserts
are, they are but faint forecasts of the state of things
existent on Mars at the present time. Only those who
as travelers have had experience of our own Saharas
can adequately picture what Mars is like and what so
waterless a condition means. Only such can understand
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
what is implied in having the local and avoidable thus
extended into the unescapable and the world-wide; and
what a terrible significance for everything Martian lies
in that single word: <em>desert</em>.</p>

  <h2 id='ch14' class='c006'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER XIV</span><br /> <br />SUMMARY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >If, now, we review with the mind’s eye the several
features of Mars which we have surveyed with the
bodily one, we shall be surprised to find to what they
commit us. Suggestive as each is considered by itself,
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</span></i> into which they combine proves of multiplicate
force in its implication. For each turns out
to fit into place in one consistent whole, a scheme of
things in which are present all the conditions necessary
to the existence and continuance of those processes
which constitute what we call life. In short, we are
conducted with a cogency, which grows as we consider
it, to the conclusion that Mars is habitable.</p>

<p class='c008' >Two ways of appreciating this cogency are open to us.
We may treat it with the simple reasoning of common-sense,
as we should a dissected map or a piece of machinery
in which we realize we are right when the
several parts at last fit together and the picture stands
revealed or the machine works. Or we may subject
the evidence to quantitative estimates for and against
by the doctrine of probabilities, and thus evaluate
the chances of its being correct. Consciously or unconsciously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
this is what we are about in our decisions
every day of our lives. At the one end of the line are
those skillful judgments where the balance is so keen-edged
that the least overweight on the one side dips the
scales to a conclusion. At the other extremity stand
those deductions which we usually speak of as proved,
such as the law of gravitation. But both assurances
rest really upon probability and differ only in degree.
What we mean by proof of anything is that a supposition
advanced to account for it explains all the facts
and is not opposed to any of them, and that the balance
of probability in consequence is very largely in its favor.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, if several pieces of evidence, distinct in their
origin, concur to a given conclusion, the probability
that that conclusion is correct is far greater than what
results from each alone; and mounts up soon to something
much exceeding what bettors at races call certainty
odds. However unversed the average man may
be in calculating the probability, he recognizes the fact
in his dealings with his fellows by the way he attaches
weight to concurrent testimony. It is such concurrent
evidence that we have now to consider. To this end
we will marshal the several facts ascertained in a summarized
list for their easier intercomparison.</p>

<p class='c008' >These facts are:—</p>

<p class='c008' >(1) Mars turns on its axis in 24 h. 37 m. 22.65 s. with
reference to the stars, and in 24 h. 39 m. 35.0 s. (as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
mean) with regard to the Sun. Its day, therefore,
is only about forty minutes longer than ours.</p>

<p class='c008' >(2) Its axis is tilted to the plane of its orbit by about
23° 59′ (most recent determination, 1905). This gives
the planet seasons almost the counterpart of our own
in character; but in length nearly double ours, for</p>

<p class='c008' >(3) Its year consists of 687 of our days, 669 of its
own.</p>

<p class='c008' >(4) Polar caps are plainly visible which melt in the
Martian summer to form again in the Martian winter,
thus implying the presence of a substance deposited
by cold.</p>

<p class='c008' >(5) As the polar caps melt, they are bordered by a
blue belt, which retreats with them. This excludes the
possibility of their being formed of carbon dioxide, and
shows that of all the substances we know the material
composing them must be water.</p>

<p class='c008' >(6) In the case of the southern cap, the blue belt has
widenings in it in places. These occur where the blue-green
areas bordering upon the polar cap are largest.</p>

<p class='c008' >(7) The extensive shrinkage of the polar snows shows
their quantity to be inconsiderable, and points to
scanty deposition due to dearth of water.</p>

<p class='c008' >(8) The melting takes place locally after the same
general order and method, Martian year after year,
both in the south cap,</p>

<p class='c008' >(9) And in the north one. This is evidenced by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
recurrence of rifts in the same places annually in each.
The water thus let loose can, therefore, be locally
counted on.</p>

<p class='c008' >(10) That the south polar cap is given to greater
extremes than the north one, implies again, in view
of the eccentricity of the orbit and the tilt of the axis,
that deposition in both caps is light.</p>

<p class='c008' >(11) The polar seas at the edges of the caps being
temporary affairs, the water from them must be fresh.</p>

<p class='c008' >(12) The melting of the caps on the one hand and
their reforming on the other affirm the presence of
water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, of whatever
else that air consist.</p>

<p class='c008' >(13) Since water vapor is present, of which the
molecular weight is 18, it follows from the kinetic
theory of gases that nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic
acid, of molecular weights 28, 32, and 38 respectively,
are probably there, too, owing to being heavier.</p>

<p class='c008' >(14) The limb-light bears testimony to this atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008' >(15) The planet’s low albedo points to a density
for the atmosphere very much less than our own.</p>

<p class='c008' >(16) The apparent evidence of a twilight goes to confirm
this.</p>

<p class='c008' >(17) Permanent markings show upon the disk, proving
that the surface itself is visible.</p>

<p class='c008' >(18) Outside of the polar cap the disk is divided into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
red-ochre and blue-green regions. The red-ochre
stretches have the same appearance as our deserts
seen from afar,</p>

<p class='c008' >(19) And behave as such, being but little affected
by change.</p>

<p class='c008' >(20) The blue-green areas were once thought
to be seas. But they cannot be such, because they
change in tint according to the Martian season, and the
area and amount of the lightening is not offset at the
time by corresponding darkening elsewhere;</p>

<p class='c008' >(21) Nor by any augmentation of the other polar
cap or precipitation into cloud. It cannot, therefore,
be due to shift of substance.</p>

<p class='c008' >(22) Furthermore, they are all seamed by lines and
spots darker than themselves which are permanent in
place; so that there can be no bodies of water on the
planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >(23) On the other hand, their color, blue-green, is
that of vegetation; this regularly fades out, as vegetation
would, to ochre for the most part, but in places
changes to a chocolate-brown.</p>

<p class='c008' >(24) The change that comes over them is seasonal
in period, as that of vegetation would be.</p>

<p class='c008' >(25) Each hemisphere undergoes this metamorphosis
in turn.</p>

<p class='c008' >(26) That it is recurrent is again proof positive of
an atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
(27) The changes are metabolic, since those in one
direction are later reversed to a restoration of the original
status. Anabolic as well as katabolic processes
thus go on there; that is, growth as well as decay takes
place. This proves them of vegetal origin.</p>

<p class='c008' >(28) The existence of vegetation shows that carbonic
acid, oxygen, and undoubtedly nitrogen, are present in
the Martian atmosphere, since plants give out oxygen
and take in carbonic acid.</p>

<p class='c008' >(29) The changes in the dark areas follow upon the
melting of the polar caps, not occurring until after
that melting is under way;</p>

<p class='c008' >(30) And not immediately then, but only after the
lapse of a certain time.</p>

<p class='c008' >(31) Though not seas now, from their look the dark
areas suggest old sea bottoms, and when on the terminator
appear as depressions (whether because really
at a lower level or because of less illumination is not
certain).</p>

<p class='c008' >(32) That they are now the parts of the planet to
support vegetation hints the same past office, as water
would naturally drain into them. That such a metamorphosis
should occur with planetary aging is in
keeping with the kinetic theory of gases.</p>

<p class='c008' >(33) Terminator observations prove conclusively
that there are no mountains on Mars, but that the
surface is surprisingly flat.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
(34) But they do reveal clouds which are usually
rare and are often, if not always, dust-storms.</p>

<p class='c008' >(35) White spots are occasionally visible, lasting
unchanged for weeks, in the tropic and temperate regions,
showing that the climate is apparently cold,</p>

<p class='c008' >(36) But at the same time proving that most of the
surface has a temperature above the freezing-point.</p>

<p class='c008' >(37) In winter the temperate zones are more or
less covered by a whitish veil, which may be hoar-frost
or may be cloud.</p>

<p class='c008' >(38) A spring haze surrounds the north polar cap
during the weeks that follow its most extensive melting.</p>

<p class='c008' >(39) Otherwise the Martian sky is perfectly clear;
like that of a dry and desert land.</p>

<p class='c008' >The way in which these thirty-nine articles fit into
one another to a mortised whole is striking enough at
first sight, but becomes more and more impressive the
more one considers it. For some are due to one kind
of observation, some to another. In the taking they
are unrelated; yet in the result they agree. Equally
pregnant is the history of their acquisition. Most of
them were detected as the outcome of observations at
the opposition of 1894, and led to the theory which was
published in the writer’s first book on the subject.
Others are the result of the five oppositions that have
since occurred. These have proved entirely corroborative
of the previous ones and of the theory then deduced,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
and that in two distinct ways: first, by the accumulated
evidence they have brought to the matter along
the old lines; and, secondly, by what they have revealed
in new directions. Of these thirty-nine articles of
Martian scientific faith in observation or deduction, (9),
(10), (21), (22), (25), (27), (28), (30), (33), (35), (36),
and (38) are in whole or part new. That continued
scrutiny is thus corroborative of the earlier results, both
along the old and along new lines of investigation, warrants
additional confidence in the conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008' >Considering, now, these counts, we see that they
make reasonably evident on Mars the presence of:—</p>

<p class='c008' >1. Days and seasons substantially like our own;</p>

<p class='c008' >2. An atmosphere containing water vapor, carbonic
acid, and oxygen;</p>

<p class='c008' >3. Water in great scarcity;</p>

<p class='c008' >4. A temperature colder than ours, but above the
Fahrenheit freezing-point, except in winter and in the
extreme polar regions;</p>

<p class='c008' >5. Vegetation.</p>

<p class='c008' >First and foremost of these is air. In order to make
it possible for vital processes of any sort to take place,
the body of a planet must be clothed with an atmosphere,
by the modesty of nature, the old astronomers
would have said. Such a covering subserves two purposes:
it keeps out the cold of space, thus permitting
the maintenance of a temperature sufficient to support
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
life, and it affords a medium through which metabolism
can go on.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now the presence of air is attested first and foremost
by the fact of change in the Martian markings, (12),
(13), (26), (28), and (35). The changes observed are
conspicuous; are both inorganic (in the case of the polar
caps), (12), (13), and (35), and metabolic or organic, (26)
and (28), (in the case of the blue-green areas); that is,
they consist of building up as well as of pulling down
and are planet-wide in occurrence. Such changes
could not occur in the absence of an atmosphere. They
show that this atmosphere consists of water vapor, (5),
carbonic acid, and oxygen, (28).</p>

<p class='c008' >The limb-light, the apparent evidence of a twilight
arc and the planet’s low albedo indicate that this atmosphere
is thin. The appearance of the surface, (35), suggests
cold, indicative again of a thin air. Such tenuity
is in accord with what <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> principles would lead
us to expect, and tends to show that reliance on general
principles is here not misplaced, a point of some interest.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lastly, the occurrence of clouds, (34), visibly floating
and traveling over the surface, and haze at times, (38),
proves in another way the existence of the medium in
which alone this could be possible.</p>

<p class='c008' >Water is the next substance vital to planetary life.
As to its actual presence the polar caps, (4)-(12), have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
most to say; as to its relative absence, the rest of the
disk, (17)-(22). The forthright conception of the polar
caps as composed of snow and ice is borne out by further
investigation into what could cause the observed phenomenon.
Carbonic acid, the only other substance we
know capable in any way of resembling what we see,
turns out not capable of producing one important detail
of the caps’ appearance, the blue band, (5), which
accompanies them in their retreat. Water alone
could do this.</p>

<p class='c008' >The melting of the caps shows that water vapor must
be a constituent of the Martian atmosphere. Moreover,
as the molecular weight of water vapor is less
than that of oxygen or nitrogen or carbon dioxide,
if the former can exist in the atmosphere of the planet,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i> must these other gases. So that from this
we have knowledge of the possibility of the presence
of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide there. From
(28) we saw that their actual existence is demonstrated.</p>

<p class='c008' >The next step is the ascertainment that the water is
in very small amount. The extensive melting of the
caps, (7), shows their quantity to be inconsiderable,
which is the first fact pointing to a dearth of water.
The second comes from the aspect and behavior of the
reddish-ochre regions which proclaim them deserts, (18)
and (19); the third from the detection of the character
of the blue-green areas as not seas, (20), (21),
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
and (22). In several different ways, study of these
regions asserts their non-aquatic constitution, the
easiest to appreciate being that they are traversed
by permanent dark lines and other equally sedentary
markings, (22). No bodies of water, therefore, are to
be seen outside of the ephemeral polar seas, immediately
surrounding the caps as they melt.</p>

<p class='c008' >This leads us to the third presence on Mars indicative
of a living world: vegetation. The other two spoke
of substances necessary to life, the premises in the case,
this one of organic existence itself, its conclusion. The
evidence consists of static testimony from the look of the
blue-green areas, (23), and of kinematic derived from
their behavior, (24), (25), (26), and (27). Vegetation
would present exactly the appearance shown by them,
and nothing that we know of but vegetation could.
But suggestive as their appearance is, it is as nothing
compared with the cogent telltale character of their
behavior. The seasonal change that sweeps over them
is metabolic, constructive as well as destructive, that is,
and proclaims an organic constitution for them such as
only vegetation could produce. In tint their metamorphoses
are those of the same substance. For the blue-green
lapses into ochre and revives again to blue-green
just as vegetation does on our own Earth at the proper
season of the year, taking both the Sun and the advent
of water into the reckoning. Furthermore, certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
of the largest dark areas turn to a chocolate-brown at
times, which is the color of fallow ground and suggestive,
at least, as occurring where the blue-green at other
seasons is the most pronounced. Lastly, the change
occurs at the epoch at which, from a knowledge of the
melting of the polar caps, theory demonstrates that it
ought to take place if it be due to the action of
vegetation.</p>

<p class='c008' >That this was the case was evident from much less
information than is forthcoming today; but what is
significant, each new fact discovered about the planet
goes to show that it is unquestionably true.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >From the detection of the main markings that diversify
the surface of Mars we now pass to a discovery
of so unprecedented a character that the scientific
world was at first loath to accept it. Only persistent
corroboration has finally broken down distrust; and,
even so, doubt of the genuineness of the phenomena
still lingers in the minds of many who have not themselves
seen the sight because of the inherent difficulty
of the observations. For it is not one where confirmation
may be summoned in the laboratory at will, but
one demanding that the watcher should wait upon the
sky, with more than ordinary acumen. This latter-day
revelation is the discovery of the canals.</p>

<p class='c008' >Quite unlike in look to the main features of the planet’s
face is this second set of markings which traverse
its disk, and which the genius of Schiaparelli disclosed.
Unnatural they may well be deemed; for they are not
in the least what one would expect to see. They
differ from the first class, not in degree, but in kind;
and the kind is of a wholly unparalleled sort. While
the former bear a family resemblance to those of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
earth; the latter are peculiar to Mars, finding no counterpart
upon the earth at all.</p>

<p class='c008' >Introduction to the mystery came about in this wise,
and will be repeated for him who is successful in his
search. When a fairly acute eyed observer sets himself
to scan the telescopic disk of the planet in steady air,
he will, after noting the dazzling contour of the white
polar cap and the sharp outlines of the blue-green seas,
of a sudden be made aware of a vision as of a thread
stretched somewhere from the blue-green across the
orange areas of the disk. Gone as quickly as it came,
he will instinctively doubt his own eyesight, and credit
to illusion what can so unaccountably disappear. Gaze
as hard as he will, no power of his can recall it, when,
with the same startling abruptness, the thing stands
before his eyes again. Convinced, after three or four
such showings, that the vision is real, he will still be
left wondering what and where it was. For so short
and sudden are its apparitions that the locating of
it is dubiously hard. It is gone each time before he
has got its bearings.</p>

<p class='c008' >By persistent watch, however, for the best instants
of definition, backed by the knowledge of what he is
to see, he will find its coming more frequent, more
certain and more detailed. At last some particularly
propitious moment will disclose its relation to well-known
points and its position be assured. First one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
such thread and then another will make its presence
evident; and then he will note that each always appears
in place. Repetition <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i> will convince him that
these strange visitants are as real as the main markings,
and are as permanent as they.</p>

<p class='c008' >Such is the experience every observer of them has
had; and success depends upon the acuteness of the
observer’s eye and upon the persistence with which he
watches for the best moments in the steadiest air. Certain
as persistence is to be rewarded at last, the difficulty
inherent in the observations is ordinarily great.
Not everybody can see these delicate features at first
sight, even when pointed out to them; and to perceive
their more minute details takes a trained as well as an
acute eye, observing under the best conditions. When
so viewed, however, the disk of the planet takes on a
most singular appearance. It looks as if it had been
cobwebbed all over. Suggestive of a spider’s web seen
against the grass of a spring morning, a mesh of fine
reticulated lines overspreads it, which with attention
proves to compass the globe from one pole to the other.
The chief difference between it and a spider’s work is
one of size, supplemented by greater complexity, but
both are joys of geometric beauty. For the lines are of
individually uniform width, of exceeding tenuity, and of
great length. These are the Martian canals.</p>

<p class='c008' >Two stages in the recognition of the reality confront
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
the persevering plodder: first, the perception of the
canals at all; and, second, the realization of their
very definite character. It is wholly due to lack of
suitable conditions that the true form of the Martian
lines is usually missed. Given the proper prerequisites
of location or of eye, and their pencil-mark peculiarity
stands forth unmistakably confessed. It is only where
the seeing or the sight is at fault that the canals either
fail to show or appear as diffuse streaks, the latter being
a halfway revelation between the reality and their not
being revealed at all. Much misconception exists on
this point. It has been supposed that improved atmospheric
conditions simply amount to bringing the
object nearer by permitting greater magnification without
altering the hazy look of its detail.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c022'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Not so. They
do much more than this. They steady the object much
as if a page of print from being violently shaken should
suddenly be held still. The observer would at once
read what before had escaped him for being a blur.
So is it with the canals. In reality, pencilings of extreme
tenuity, the agitations of our own air spread them
into diffuse streaks; an effect of which any one may
assure himself by sufficiently rapid motion of a drawing
in which they are depicted sharp and distinct, when he
will see them take on the streaky look. As the writer
has observed them under both aspects, and has seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
them pass from the indefinite to the defined as the
seeing improved, he has had practical proof of the fact,
and this not once, but an untold number of times.</p>

<p class='c008' >Atmospheric conditions far superior to what are good
enough for most astronomic observations are needed
for such planetary decipherment, and the observer
experienced in the subject eventually learns how all-important
this is. Under these conditions the testimony
of his own eyesight upon the character of these
markings is definite and complete. And the first trait
that then emerges from confusion is that the markings
are <em>lines</em>; not simply lines in the sense that any sufficiently
narrow and continuous marking may so be
called, but lines in the far more precise sense in which
geometry uses the term. They are furthermore straight
lines. As Schiaparelli said of them: they look to have
been laid down by rule and compass. The very marvel
of the sight has been its own stumbling-block to recognition,
joined to the difficulty of its detection. For not
only is the average observatory not equipped by nature
for the task, but what is not good air often masquerades
as such. Trains of air waves exist at times so fine
as to confuse this detail, or even to obliterate it entirely;
while at the same time they leave the disk seemingly
sharp-cut, with the result that one not well versed
in such vagaries thinks to see well when in truth he is
debarred from seeing at all. When study of the conditions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
finally ends in putting him upon the right road,
the sight that rewards him can hardly be too graphically
described.</p>

<p class='c008' >Next to the fact that they are <em>lines</em>, definiteness of
direction is the chief of their characteristics to strike
the observer. The lines run straight throughout their
course. This is absolutely true of ninety per cent of
them, and practically so of the remaining ten per cent,
since the latter curve in an equally symmetric manner.
Such directness has I know not what of immediate impressiveness.
Quite unlike the aspect of the main
markings, which show a natural irregularity of outline,
these lines offer at the first glance a most unnatural
regularity of look. Nothing on Earth of natural origin
on such a scale bears them analogue. Nor does any
other planet show the like. They are, in fact, distinctively
Martian phenomena. This is the first point
in which they differ from the markings we have hitherto
described. The others were generic planetary features;
these are specific ones, peculiar to Mars.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c022'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
Equally striking is the uniform width of each line from
its beginning to its end, as it stands out there upon the
disk. The line varies not in size throughout its course
any more than it deviates in direction. It counterfeits
a telegraph wire stretched from point to point. Like
the latter seen afar, the width, too, is telegraphic. For
it is not so much width as want of it that is evident.
Breadth is inferable solely from the fact that the line
is seen at all, and relative size by difference of insistency.
Indeed, the apparent breadth has been steadily
contracting as the instrumental, atmospheric, and personal
conditions have improved. All three of the
factors have conduced to such emaceration, but the
middle one the most. For the air waves spread every
marking, and the effect is relatively greatest upon those
which are most slender. As the currents of condensation
and rarefaction pulse along, their denser and their
thinner portions refract the rays on either side of their
true place, and thus at the same time confuse a marking
and broaden it. The consequence is that the better
the atmospheric conditions and the more that has been
learned about utilizing them, the finer the lines have
shown themselves to be.</p>

<p class='c008' >Herein we have a specific intrinsic difference between
the fundamental features and these lines: the main
markings have extension in two dimensions, the latter
in one.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
Distinctive as they thus are, they have, in keeping with
their appearance, been given a distinctive name, that of
canal. Useful as the name is and, as we shall later see,
applicable, it must not be supposed that what we see
are such in any simple sense. No observer of them has
ever considered them canals dug like the Suez Canal
or the phœnix-like Panama one. This supposition
is exclusively of critic creation.</p>

<p class='c008' >Their precise width is not precisable. They show
no measurable breadth and their size, therefore, admits
for certain only of an outside limit. They cannot
be wider than a determinable maximum, but they may
be much less than this. The sole method of estimating
their width is by comparison of effect with a wire of
known caliber at a known distance. For this purpose
a telegraph wire was stretched against the sky at
Flagstaff, and the observers, going back upon the mesa,
observed and recorded its appearance as their stations
grew remote. It proved surprising at what great distances
a slender wire could be made out when thus
projected against the sky. The wire in the experiment
was but 0.0726 of an inch in diameter and yet could be
seen with certainty at a distance of 1800 feet, at which
point its diameter subtended only 0.69 of a second of
arc. How small this quantity is may be appreciated
from its taking more than ninety such lines laid side
by side to make a width divisible by the eye. Such
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
slenderness at the then distance of Mars would correspond,
under the magnification commonly used, only
to three quarters of a mile. Theoretically, then, a line
three quarters of a mile wide there should be visible
to us. Practically, both light and definition is lost
in the telescope, and it would be nearer the mark to consider
in such case two miles as the limit of the perceptible.
With the planet nearer than this, as is often the
case, the width which could be seen would be proportionally
lessened. Perhaps we shall not be far astray
if we put one mile as the limiting width which could be
perceived on Mars at present, with distance at its least
and definition at its best.</p>

<p class='c008' >That so minute a quantity should be visible at all
is due to the line having a sensible length and by summation
of sensations causing to rise into consciousness
what would otherwise be lost. A stimulus too feeble
to produce an effect upon a single retinal rod becomes
recognizable when many in a row are similarly excited.</p>

<p class='c008' >The experiment furnished another criterion, of importance
as regards the supposition that the lines on
Mars are illusory. It showed that brain-begotten impressions
of wires that did not exist could be told from
the real thing when the wire subtended 0.69 of a second
of arc or more; that below this the outside stimulus
was too weak to differ recognizably from optic effects
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
otherwise produced; while when the real wire was
diminished to 0.59′′, it could not be seen at all. Now,
the majority of lines on Mars so far recognized and
mapped lie in strength of impression far above the
superior limit of 0.69′′. To one versed in Martian canal
detection there is no possibility of self-deception in the
case, the canals being very much more salient objects
to an expert than those who have not seen them suppose.
For it must not be imagined that, when one
knows what to be on the lookout for, they are the difficult
objects they seem to the tyro. Just as the satellites
of Mars were easily seen once they were discovered,
so with these lines.</p>

<p class='c008' >A mile or two we may take, then, with safety as the
smallest width for one of the lines. The greatest was
got by comparing what is by far the largest canal, the
Nilosyrtis, with the micrometer thread. From such
determination it appeared that this canal was from
25 to 30 miles wide. But it is questionable whether
the Nilosyrtis can properly be termed a canal, so
much does it exceed the rest. It is certainly far
larger than the majority of them. From comparative
estimates between its size and that of the others, 15
to 20 miles for the width of the larger of the Martian
canals seems the most probable value, and 2 or 3
miles only of the more diminutive of those so far
detected.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Showing the Eumenides-Orcus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >On the other hand, the length of the canals is relatively
enormous. With them 2000 miles is common;
while many exceed 2500, and
the Eumenides-Orcus is 3540
miles from the point where
it leaves the Phœnix Lake
to the point where it enters
the Trivium Charontis. This
means much more on Mars
than it would on Earth,
owing to the smaller size of
the planet. Such a length exceeds a third of the
whole circumference of its globe at the equator.
But what is still more remarkable, throughout the
whole of the long course taken by the canal, it swerves
neither to the right nor to the left of the great circle
joining the two points.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of these several peculiarities of the individual canal
it is difficult to know to which to allot the palm for
oddity,—great circle directness, excessive length, want
of width, or striking uniformity. Each is so anomalously
unnatural as to have received the approving
stamp of incredulity. Yet so much, wonderful as it is,
is encountered on the very threshold of the subject.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Much more stands beyond. For, outdoing in
suggestiveness the individual traits of the lines,
is the relation shown by them to one another. It is
the communal characteristics of the phenomenon that
are most surprising.</p>

<p class='c008' >The individual peculiarities of the lines impress
themselves at once; the communal, only as the result
of experience, collation, and thought. As the observer
becomes trained, the more lines he is able to make out,
until they fairly seam the whole surface of the light
areas of the planet. Their name collectively is legion;
while to name them individually is fast getting, for the
number detected, to be impossible. As with the increasing
family of asteroids, figures alone will prove
adequate to the task.</p>

<p class='c008' >Interdependence, not independence, marks the attitude
of the canals. Each not only proceeds with absolute
directness from one point to another, but at its
terminals it meets canals which have come there with
like forthrightness from other far places upon the planet.
Nor is it two only that thus come together at a common
junction. Three, four, five,—up to as many as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
fourteen,—thus make rendezvous, and it is a poor
junction that cannot show at least six or seven. The
result is a network which triangulates the surface of the
planet like a geodetic survey into polygons of all shapes
and sizes, the Arian areolas. The size of the pieces
forming this tesselate ground depends solely upon the
fineness of the definition. With every increase in the
power of seeing, each areola is cut into still smaller
portions, usually by connection between its corners.
Thus a polygon or rhombus is split into triangles which
may themselves be divided in like manner, the mosaic
breaking into bits, the sides of which, however, always
remain clean-cut.</p>

<p class='c008' >From this arrangement it is at once evident that the
canals are not fortuitously placed. That lines should
thus meet exactly and in numbers at particular points,
and only there, shows that their locating is not the outcome
of chance. If very thin rods be thrown haphazard
over a surface, the probability that more than
two will cross at the same point is vanishingly small.
Increasingly assured is it that this would not happen
generally. The result we see is therefore not a matter
of chance, but of some law working to that end.</p>

<p class='c008' >To the detection of what that law is precedes the
easier ascertainment of what it is not. The lines, for
example, cannot be rivers, which was the first explanation
offered of them by Proctor many years ago, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
of their peculiar straightness. Nor can they be
channels, the name given to them by Schiaparelli,
except in the non-committal sense in which he used the
term. For here again their geometric regularity is bar
to any estuary-like hypothesis. For quite another reason
they cannot be cracks, because of their uniform
size throughout. Their unbroken character is another
fatal objection to the same suggestion. For cracks in
ground never pursue for any great distance a continuous
course, any more than they keep uniform or straight.
The state of an old ceiling is a case in point. When it
breaks, it does so in fissures that proceed a certain way,
then give out to be continued by others roughly parallel
to the first, but parted from them. The same character
is shown by the rills on the moon. The ‘Straight
Wall,’ so called, is composed of three such sections, and
the little rill to the right of it, west of Birt, of four.</p>

<p class='c008' >Thus were they seen at Flagstaff, and as, to the
writer’s knowledge, they have not been so depicted
elsewhere, the fact may serve to give some idea of the
definition there.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the underlying cause is not explosion or contraction
is also evidenced by the canals collectively
as well as individually, their arrangement into a system,
for cracks, however produced, could only originate
from certain centres and could not fit into those
starting from others, as the canals invariably do. For
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
each canal goes as undeviatingly to one terminal as it
left forthrightly from another. If one wishes to see
what explosion or contraction can do, he has only to
look at the moon through an opera-glass, when he will
be shown a very different sight from what the drawings
of Mars detail. Thus just as, considered individually,
the lines cannot be watercourses because of their
straightness, so they cannot be cracks because of dovetailing
into one another.</p>

<p class='c008' >The fact that they form a system shows that whatever
caused them operated over the whole planet, linked
in cause as in effect throughout each section. This at
once negatives any purely physical cause of which we
have cognizance. For upon a globe still so subject to
physical vicissitude as Mars by its aspect shows itself
to be, latitude must tell in the phenomena its zones
exhibit. Polar snows that wax and wane speak of
arctic conditions very diverse from temperate and
tropic states, and what would affect the one could not
influence the other. Yet the mesh rises superior to
zonal solicitation as to local barrier. It is not something
dependent either on the temperament or the
complexion of the globe’s different parts. It transcends
surface restriction and becomes planet-wide in its
working. The importance of this omnipresence dilates
in meaning as one dwells in thought upon it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Ubiquitous as it is, the mesh which thus covers the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
Martian surface like a veil spread completely over it,
is unlike a veil in being of irregular texture. Not only
are the interstices of various shape and pattern, but the
mesh itself is of locally differing size. Though the
threads are straight and uniform throughout, they are
not all alike, besides being unsymmetrically interwoven.
Some are at least of ten times the coarseness
of others, and from this fact and the bo-peep effect of
our air waves all are not visible at once. In consequence
the network is not so impressive at first glance
as it becomes upon a synthesis of the observations.
When this is done, the surface proves to be fairly
evenly cut up, as recourse to the maps printed in this
volume will amply demonstrate. These maps, as on
page <a href='#Page_31'>31</a>, are made from the results of but one opposition,
and as at each opposition some zone is in a more
canal-showing state than others, owing to the Martian
season at the time, a still greater uniformity in canal
distribution results from a blending of many.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the completeness of the mesh, it follows that in
the course taken severally by the canals no one direction
preponderates over another. Considered by and
large, the canals seem to be equally distributed round
the compass points; and this at all longitudes and
nearly all latitudes. Tropic, temperate, and even arctic
canals show a pleasing impartiality in the matter of
the course pursued. The only exceptions occur in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
neighborhood of the pole. There a slight tendency
may be seen to a north and south setting.</p>

<p class='c008' >Though so much is visible in a general way from the
map, it is of interest to go into the subject with more
particularity and to that end to show it statistically.
The several canals traversing each zone were therefore
counted, and the area of the zone computed. The manner
of canal distribution thus found is given in the
following table, in the second column of which stand the
areas of the several zones upon the planet, each ten
degrees wide, except the one next the snow, and in the
third the number of canals found traversing them, reduced
to percentages of the 0°-10° zone. A fourth column
shows the total length of the canals in each zone,
those from 0° to 20° being taken from the 1896 globe,
those from 20° to 90° from the 1903. This is in order
to annul the effect of the seasons upon the showing of
the canals as much as possible.</p>

The numbers continue fairly non-committal until
we begin to approach the pole, when they commence
to increase. Much the same result is got if we take
the actual canal-lengths in each zone, as the fourth column
shows. The crowding of the canals poleward is
marked. The canals, therefore, are phenomena that
stand in peculiar relationship to the polar cap. This
corroborates the inference about them due to their
running out of the edge of the snow. They not only
emanate from it, but they do so in numbers surpassing
what is elsewhere observable over the disk.</p>

<p class='c008' >Otherwise is it with their departure-points. These
are not scattered haphazard over the surface, but bear
to its general features definite relations. If we consider
the map, obliterating the lines, and then seek to connect
the most salient points of the planet’s topography by
direct avenues of communication, we shall find that our
putative lines fall exactly where the real ones occur.
For the most part, the real lines emanate from well-marked
indentations in the dark regions, fitted by
natural position for departure-points, what, if these
were seas, we should call their most conspicuous bays.
They thus leave in the southern hemisphere the deeper
folds of the great diaphragm, for the most part; though
on occasion they run out of them where they will.
From equally conspicuous points in the dark northern
areas other lines proceed; while in the centre of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
continents, the canals make for more or less salient
spots, small patches of shading like the Trivium or the
Wedge of Casius, or simply round black radiants, like
the Luci Ismenii.</p>

<p class='c008' >From this it appears that the lines are locally dependent
upon the general topography of the fundamental
features of the surface. For some reason they
connect the very points most suggestive of intercommunication.
As from their characteristics it is perfectly
evident that the lines are neither rivers nor
cracks, it follows that such a communicating habit is
of the most telltale character. To be so dissimilar in
kind from the main markings and yet so dependent
upon them, hints that their positioning occurred after
the formation of the main features themselves. We
reach thus from the look of the lines and their location
a most striking deduction, that the lines are not coeval
with the main markings, but have come into being later
and with reference to the general topography of the
planet. The network is not only a mesh <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i>, then,
but one <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i>, which, subsequent to the fashioning of
the seas and continents and what these have now become,
has been superposed upon them.</p>

<p class='c008' >In 1879, while Schiaparelli was engaged in scrutinizing
the strange <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canali</span></i> he had discovered on the planet
the opposition before, he was suddenly surprised to
mark one of them double. Two closely parallel lines
confronted him where but a single one had previously
stood. So unaccountable did the sight seem, that he
hesitated to credit what he saw, being minded to attribute
the vision to illusion of some sort and the more
so that it was not renewed. While he was still wondering
what it meant, the planet parted company with the
Earth, carrying its enigma with it.</p>

<p class='c008' >When the two bodies again drew near to one another
in 1882, Schiaparelli set himself to watch for a recurrence
of the strange phenomenon. Before long it came, and
more bewilderingly than at first; for not one canal
alone, but a score of them now showed in duplicate,
each presenting to his astonished gaze twin lines perfectly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_193' id='Page_193'>193</a></span>
matched and preserving throughout their distance
apart. Suspecting diplopia or some other optical
trick, he tried various eyepieces to a test of the cause
but to no change in the effect. The twin lines continued
visible, do what he would, insisting on their own
reality in spite of all solicitation to merge. How cautious
he was in the matter, and how unwilling at first
to believe the evidence of his eyes, is shown by the care
he took to guard against deception. It was not until
he had assured himself of the reality of the phenomena
that he believed what he had seen.</p>

<p class='c008' >It so chanced that my first experience of the thing
was almost equally startling, so unexpected was it and
so exceedingly sharp was the definition at the time.
It was in an autumn early twilight, through air almost
perfectly still, as the light went out of the sky and the
markings on the planet began to come forth that the
Phison of a sudden showed in duplicate to me, clear-cut
upon the disk, its twin lines like the rails of a railway
track traversing Aeria. Not more vivid do those of
our transcontinental tracks appear as one sees them
stretching off into the distance upon our Western
plains. More impressive was the sight from the fact
that I was not looking for it. It simply suddenly
stood forth, this strange parallelism of pencil lines.
My surprise matched the wonder of the sight.</p>

<p class='c008' >Since then I have witnessed it several hundred times,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
but never with more absolute certainty than at that
first fortunate revelation. To this distinctness is due
the amazement it then aroused. Not simply because
of its surpassing novelty, but for the insistence with
which it proclaimed itself was the effect to be ascribed.
Less well seen, doubt had robbed it of its full surprise.
It requires as a rule steady definition for its initial
unmistakable showing, if one would be instantly convinced.
Except for such it is not usually easy to the
unpracticed, though often discernible to the expert
after it has once been seen. But that it is real no one
who had had a good view of the sight could doubt;
still less after the experience had been repeated over
and over again.</p>

<p class='c008' >What appears to take place is this: where previously
a single pencil-like line joined two well-known
points upon the disk, twin lines, the one the replica of
the other, stand forth in its stead. The two lines of the
pair are but a short distance apart, are of the same size,
of the same length, and absolutely equidistant throughout
their course. It is as if a second line had in some
way been mysteriously added to the first since the
latter was last seen some weeks before. This in a word
is the phenomenon, technically called the gemination
of the canals, which has since its discovery called forth
so much comment. It is not in reality quite as simple
or as sudden as it seems, but this was the way in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_195' id='Page_195'>195</a></span>
the phenomenon was first seen and in which it still
continues to be criticised.</p>

<p class='c008' >Self-assertive of reality, the double lines are patently
objective to him who is fortunate enough to see them
well. Nevertheless the great difficulty of detecting
them, and the still greater difficulty of conceiving how
such things can be, has led many not versed in the subject
to disbelieve and from that to attempt to explain
the sight as illusory. Scepticism seeks self-justification;
what is hard of acceptance for its strangeness begetting
hypotheses of committed error which find easy credence
for their comforting conservatism. Several
such have in consequence been propounded to account
for the double canals. There is the diplopic theory
which credits them to non-focusing; the interferential
theory which would make them optical products of the
telescope; and the illusion theory which would have
them quite simply imaginary.</p>

<p class='c008' >Inasmuch as in any research the assurance that a
phenomenon is real is the first point about it to be
established, it is a scientist’s duty, not only to scan the
phenomena with jealous care to that end, but to scrutinize
every theory which would seek otherwise to
account for them—the testing such being only second
in importance to observing the things themselves.
Accordingly I have examined each of the optical theories
that have been advanced and critically compared
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
what they assert and require with the results of observation.
The outcome of this research has proved as
negativing to any other origin for the double canals
than reality as direct observations at the telescope are
positive on the point. To show this I shall review
each in its consequences, confronting it with what the
telescope has to say on the subject; for it is of the pith
of the matter that the reality should be as demonstrable
on demand as on sight. Furthermore, I shall
do this before embarking on the general account of these
strange things, because it is vital to any interest that
one should be assured from the start of the truth of
what he is to read. The preface may seem to him abstruse
and prosy, but it will introduce him to some curious
optical properties and will eventually enhance his
concern by proving to him that what reads like fiction
is all the more wonderful for being fact.</p>

<h3 id='ch17p1' class='c028'><i>I. The Diplopic Theory</i></h3>

<p class='c008' >Diplopia is the property of seeing double with one eye.
Surprising as it sounds it is an effect not unknown to
students of optics, though it usually requires training
to produce. It is possible only when the eye is not
focused on the object, and is not always possible then.
From my experiments its feasibility seems to depend
upon whether the focus be beyond or before what it
should be. If the eye be focused for a point beyond the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
object, the object is doubled, if for a point this side of
it, the latter is simply blurred. When the double is
formed, the amount of the separation of the two images
is a function of the distance the focus is out. The
greater the discrepancy, the wider apart is the ensuing
double. Nor does the image, of a line, for example,
stop at doubling. After a certain breadth of separation
is reached a third line appears, bisecting the interval
between the other two. With yet greater widening
the third line itself splits into a pair and so the resolution
goes on. In my own experiments I have gone
so far as to suspect a fifth line. Far from being unconscious,
the process of producing the phenomenon is,
with some people, of difficult accomplishment. Mr.
Lampland, for instance, of the Flagstaff Observatory,
to whom we owe the first photographing of the canals,
and who sees the doubles of Mars without difficulty,
has hitherto found diplopic vision an impossible feat.
Even with the most practiced diplopia is never unconscious
except when the object viewed, as a micrometer
wire, has nothing to locate it in space. Now, the diplopic
theory of the double canals supposes that in all
cases the eye of the observer is thus unconsciously
out of focus.</p>

<p class='c008' >To this method of their manufacture the telescopic
phenomena prove unamenable on five counts.</p>

<p class='c008' >1. Focusing the eye on an object is now a reflex action,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
so automatic has it become; in consequence one is
commonly directly conscious when an object is not in
focus, always so when the object presents detail. Were
such not the case we should never, except by chance,
see anything defined. Observing through a telescope,
after a modicum of practice, differs in no respect from
observing in everyday life. Consequently, that an
experienced observer should not know his business
in so primary a matter is preposterous. One may or
may not believe that “the undevout astronomer is
mad,” but that the perpetually unfocused one would
be is beyond debate.</p>

<p class='c008' >2. Generically unlikely, the failure to focus is here
specifically out of the question. For the observer does
not use the canals to focus on for the simple reason that
he cannot. Like all delicate detail, the doubles appear
not continuously but by flashes of revelation, according
as the atmospheric waves permit of passage undisturbed.
To focus on them would be next to impossible
even were it resorted to—which it never is. By the
exponents of the theory this important fact is overlooked:
the unforeseen showing of the canals and therefore
the absolute lack of complicity of the eye in the
matter. What one focuses on is the look of the main
markings of the disk. Now, to suppose an observer
systematically out in his perceptions of so featureful
a planet as that of Mars, so that he does not know when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
he sees its image sharp, implies a lack of knowledge
of astronomic observation in the supposer.</p>

<p class='c008' >3. Study by the writer shows the width of a given
double canal to be constant for a given date. Within
the errors of perception or recording the twin lines are
always at the same epoch the same distance apart.
The greater the number of determinations made, the
nearer the result approaches to this mean; and the
greater the care used in delineation, the less each value
departs from it.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, if the thing were a matter of mistaken focusing,
an eye could not be thus true to its own mistakes. If
it were out in its focus by a certain amount at one time,
it would be likely to be out by a different amount at
another. So that by the very terms of its making a
diplopic double would be sure to vary. Indeed, in
laboratory experiments it is impossible to prevent it.
For the eye rests itself automatically by change of focus,
and if it be not consciously kept awry it reverts as near
to the true focus as it can of its own accord.</p>

<p class='c008' >4. Diplopia might be a respecter of persons, but it
certainly could not be one of canals. For a given observer
it must be objectively general in its application
to the same class of objects. Consequently, if the doubling
were diplopic, all canals inclined at the same angle
to the vertical—for the tilt might affect the result
were the eye astigmatic—should be similarly affected.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
Parallel canals should parallel each other’s action.
With the Martian doubles this is not the case. Of two
canals similarly inclined the one will be double, the
other not, at the same instant and under conditions
that are alike. And this persistently. For gemination
is an attribute of certain canals and never of others.
At a given season of the Martian year, some canals are
regularly double, some invariably single. Night after
night and presentation after presentation these idiosyncrasies
are preserved: the doubles, always pairs, the
single, always alone. Nor does the strength of the line
affect the action. The single canals are some of them
stronger, some of them weaker, than the doubles seen
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008' >5. If of diplopic origin the mean width of all the
doubles should be the same. For though the diplopic
width would vary for a given canal according to the
moment, a sufficient number of views would yield a
mean width which would be the same for all. Tilt
apart, the mean width of one canal would be that of
another. Among Martian doubles, on the contrary,
I have found the width to be a specific property
of the particular canal. Each has its own mean width
regardless of inclination, and this individual width
differs as between one and another by as much as five
to two, or, if we consider such canals as the Nilokeras
I and II, by more than ten to two.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_201' id='Page_201'>201</a></span>
Any one of these five points is fatal to the theory;
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i> all.</p>

<h3 id='ch17p2' class='c028'><i>II. The Interference Theory</i></h3>

<p class='c008' >From the wave propagation of light it follows that
the image of a bright line made by a lens is not itself
a simple bright line but a bright band flanked by alternate
dark and bright ones. It has, therefore, been suggested
that a bright medial line is here concerned and
that the double canal is the first of its dark pair of outriders.
But the suggestion does not bear scrutiny.</p>

<p class='c008' >1. It presupposes a central streak brighter than the
rest of the disk to give birth to the twin dark lines.
This should itself be visible in the image; but no such
bright backbone is seen.</p>

<p class='c008' >2. It demands a perfectly definite width of separation
for a given aperture—which is not that observed.</p>

<p class='c008' >3. It makes the width a function of the aperture,
decreasing as this increases—which is not sustained
by observation. Different apertures produce no effect
on the widths of the Martian doubles, as the writer has
shown (Lowell Observatory Bulletin, No. 5) by a change
of aperture from twenty-four to six inches.</p>

<p class='c008' >4. Under like optical conditions the optically produced
doubles would be all of a width; while the Martian
ones show idiosyncratic widths, each peculiar to
itself.</p>

<div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
<h3 id='ch17p3' class='c028'><i>III. The Illusion Theory</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Known also as the Small Boy Theory from the ingenuous
simplicity on which it rests, this theory attacks
the reality of the doubles by questioning that of the
canals <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en bloc</span></i>. Because some boys from the Greenwich
(Reform or) Charity School, set to copy a canal-expurgated
picture of the planet, themselves supplied
the lines which had preceptorily been left out, the
Martian canals have been denied existence; which is
like saying that because a man may see stars without
scanning the heavens, therefore those in the sky do not
exist. As to the instructions the boys received we are
left in the dark. It looks as if some leading questions
had unconsciously been put to them. At all events,
English charity boys would seem to be particularly
pliant to such imagination, for when Flammarion retried
the experiment with French schoolboys, and even
inserted spaced dots for the canals in the copy, not a
boy of them drew an illusory line.</p>

<p class='c008' >The fact is, this is one of those deceptive half-truths
which is so much more deleterious than an unmitigated
mistake. Under certain circumstances it is quite possible
to perceive illusory lines, due either to shadings
otherwise unmarked and thus synthesized or to immediately
precedent retinal impressions transferred
to places where they do not belong by rapid motion
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
of the eye, as I had myself discovered before the
English experiment had been tried. But, as I have
also found out, these effects are produced only at the
limit of vision, and in that limbo of uncertainty the
whole art of the observer consists in learning to distinguish
the true from the false. Strength of impression,
renewed effect <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</span></i>, and a peculiar sense of
reality or the reverse enable him to adjudge the two.
More experience than the boys possessed would have
helped them to part the sheep from the goats. But,
furthermore, and fatally to the theory here in question,
the Martian canals when well seen are not at the limit
of vision as its framers supposed, but well within that
boundary of doubt; so that the premise upon which the
whole theory rests gives way. Under good atmospheric
conditions the canals are comparable for conspicuousness
to many of the well-recognized Fraunhofer lines
and are just as certainly there.</p>

<p class='c008' >Thus each attempt to prove the doubles non-objective
turns out when specifically examined to be inconsistent
with the facts. With the assurance of their
reality thus made doubly sure, we pass to consideration
of the things themselves.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c029'>I</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c030'     >Rightly viewed, no more subtle tribute could be
paid to the remarkable character of the phenomenon
of gemination than the scepticism with which it
was immediately received and which it still continues
to elicit. That the sight should be regarded as illusory
speaks for its surpassing strangeness; and so far as
oddity goes the encomium is certainly deserved. Of
the bizarre features of this curiously marked disk,
the double canals were at the time of their discovery
the culmination, and though things stranger still if
possible have since been seen there, it is not wonderful
that doubt should still incredulously stare. If the mere
account of them reads like romance, to see them is an
experience.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nothing astronomical that I have ever seen has been
so startlingly impressive as my first view of a double
canal. Even in narration the thing justifies its effect.
For a double canal consists of a pair of twin dark filaments,
perfectly parallel throughout their course and
inclosing between them ground of the same ochreish
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
cast as that which lies without. Only on occasion is
this tint of their midway departed from, and then only
toward a darkening, never toward a lightening of it.
Except for appearing paired, the lines resemble precisely
the usual single canals. In length they vary
from a few hundred to a few thousand miles, while in
width each component, for narrowness, hardly permits
of definite ascription.</p>

<p class='c008' >Compared for strength with the usual canal the lines
of a double seem to hold on the average an intermediate
position between the larger and the smaller of the single
canals so far detected. Owing, however, to the massed
effect of the pair by reason of their closeness, they have
an advantage in showing over the singles of two to one.
And this renders them among the most conspicuous and
important meshes of the canal network.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like the single canals, they vary in strength with the
Martian time of year; at certain seasons developing
into heavy pencil lines and at others fading away to the
merest gossamers, only just discernible like cobwebs
stretched across the face of the planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >Although the individual constituent lines vary in
aspect and never rise at their most to cognizable
breadth, the distance parting their centres, or the width
of the double, is quite measurable. The only difficulty
in the way of its determination lies in the absence of a
procurable unit small enough to mete it. The usual
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
spider-threads of the micrometer are colossal in comparison
with these filaments and present a standard
only analogic at best. Nevertheless, by means of the
finest threads that could be got, estimates of the distance
between the pairs were made at Flagstaff in 1905,
and the results agree as closely as the means permit
with those got by measurement of the doubles as
depicted in the drawings.</p>

<div id='i_b_206' class='imgleft'>
<div class='illus-300'>
 <img src='images/i_b_206.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='ce-caption'>Martian doubles.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Of what they look like, the following illustrations
give a fair idea, only that instead of being more geometrically
regular in the
drawing than in reality the
fact is the other way. Freehand
draftsmanship at the
telescope is incapable of rendering
their ruled effect. No
railway metals could be laid
down with more precision.
As to their size, the following
figures derived from a typical double canal, the Phison,
give some conception. This great artery of intercommunication
between the Sabaeus Sinus and the
Nilosyrtis is, roughly speaking, 2250 miles long; the
distance between the centres of the two constituents
is about 130 miles, and each line is perhaps 20 miles
in breadth, when at its maximum strength. The
pair follow, apparently, the arc of a great circle from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
the Portus Sigaeus on the Mare Icarium to the Pseboas
Lucus in latitude 40° north. The Portus Sigaeus consists
of two little nicks in the coastline, looking like
the carets one makes in
checking off items down a
list, if the space between
the down and up strokes
were then filled in; the
Pseboas Lucus, on the other
hand, is a large round dot
like a small ink spot. To
these two differently appearing
spots, the twin lines of
the Phison behave differently. While each line leaves
centrally its own caret of the Portus Sigaeus at the
south, at the north each touches peripherally the
Pseboas Lucus, on the east and west sides respectively,
the two thus just holding the Lucus between them.
In position the lines are invariable, though in visibility
not. Sometimes only one is seen, sometimes both show
faintly, and sometimes both are conspicuously strong.
The delicacy of the observations by which this detail
was established is second only to its importance. It
destroys at a stroke all possibility of diplopic unreality,
since were that the fact the Pseboas Lucus
should be doubled, which it is not. At the same time
it opens vistas into the true construction of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
things themselves, at present more suggestive than
satisfactory.</p>

<div id='i_b_207' class='imgright'>
<div class='illus-300'>
 <img src='images/i_b_207.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='ce-caption'>Martian doubles (corroborating the above).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >In the great circle character of its course the Phison
is quite normal. The majority of the double canals
pursue the like method, running straight over the
surface from one point to another, the constituents
remaining equidistant throughout. But such forthrightness
of direction, though the rule, is not without
exceptions. The Thoth-Nepenthes, for example,
sweeps round in a seemingly continuous curve to the
west-southwest from the Aquae Calidae to the Lucus
Moeris like some mighty bow perpetually bent. Nevertheless
its lines are no less careful for all their curving
to keep their distance from one end to the other of their
course. The quality of being paired rises superior to
change of direction.</p>

<h3 class='c029'>II</h3>

<p class='c008' >Now, the first point to be noticed about the doubles
is that bilateralism, or the quality of being double,
is not a universal trait of the canals, either actually or
potentially; it is not even a general one. Out of the
four hundred canals seen at Flagstaff, only fifty-one
have at any time displayed the quality; that is, one
eighth roughly of the whole number observed. This
point is most important; for the fact is of itself enough
to disprove any optical origin for the phenomenon.
The characteristic of doubling so confidently ascribed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
by those who have not seen it to general optical or ocular
principles proves thus the exception, not the rule, with
the canals, and by so doing disowns the applicability
of any merely optical solution. We shall encounter
many more equally prohibitive bars to illusory explanation
before we have done with the doubles, but it is
interesting to meet one in this manner at the very
threshold of the subject.</p>

<p class='c008' >On the other hand, the characteristic when possessed
is persistent in the particular canal, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in posse</span></i> if not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in esse</span></i>.
Once shown by a canal, that canal may confidently
be looked to at a proper time to disclose it again.
In short, bilateralism, or the state of being dual, is an
inherent attribute of the individual canal, as idiosyncratic
to it as position and size.</p>

<p class='c008' >The catalogue of canals possessing this property,
so far as they have been detected at Flagstaff to date,
number fifty-one if we include in the list wide parallels
like the Nilokeras I and II. Eight of these were observed
in 1894; nineteen more were added in 1896,
making twenty-seven; in 1901 the total was raised to
thirty; in 1903 to forty-eight; and in 1905 to fifty-one.
Arranged by years they are tabulated below, where the
numeral to the left registers for each its first recording
and the position held by it in the list. The starred
canals much exceed the others in width, and possibly
denote a different phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c021' >In spite of possessing the property of pairing, a canal
may not always exhibit it. To the production of the
phenomenon the proper time is as essential as the
property itself. So far as a primary scanning or first
approximation is capable of revealing, a canal will be
single at one Martian season and double at another.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
Thus these canals alternated in their state to Schiaparelli
and for the earlier of his own observed oppositions
to the writer. In consequence Schiaparelli
deemed gemination a process which the canal periodically
underwent. Three stages in the development
were to him distinguishable: the single aspect, a short
confused aspect, and the clearly dual one.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the single state the canal remained most of the
time. It then underwent a chrysalid stage of confusion
to emerge of a sudden into a perfect pair. Furthermore,
he noted the times at which the pairing took
place, to the formulating of a law in the case—derived
from the observations of more than one opposition.
His law was that the gemination occurred, on the average,
three months (ours) after the summer solstice
of the northern hemisphere, lasted four to five months,
then faded out to begin afresh one month after the vernal
equinox of the same hemisphere and continue for four
months more. Expressed in Martian seasonal chronology,
the periods would be about half as long. At
certain times then the most pronounced specimens of
doubles showed obstinately single, while the periodic
metamorphosis that transformed them into duplicates
was timed to the changes of the planet’s year. Gemination,
then, was a seasonal phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c008' >Advance in our knowledge of the phenomenon since
Schiaparelli’s time, while still showing the thing to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
of seasonal habit, has changed our conception of it.
It now appears that in some cases certainly, and possibly
in all, the dual aspect is not a temporary condition,
but the differing pronouncement of a permanent state,
the fact of gemination so called being confined to a
filling out of what is always skeletonly there. As the
canals have come to be better seen, the three stages of
existence have in some cases become recognizable as
only different degrees in discernment of an essential
double condition; the single appearance being due to
the relative feebleness of one of the constituents and the
confused showing to the weakness of both, which are
then the more easily blurred by the air waves. In certain
canals the last few oppositions, 1901, 1903, and
1905, have disclosed this unmistakably to be the case,
as with the Phison and Euphrates, for example. With
them the double character has been continuously visible,
appearing not only when by Schiaparelli’s law it should,
but at the times when it should not; only on these latter
occasions it was harder to see, whence the reason it was
previously missed. So that further scrutiny, while in
no sense discrediting the earlier observations, has extended
to them some modification, and disclosed the
underlying truth to be the varying visibility, the thing
itself, except for strength in part or whole, persisting
the same. Improvement in definition has lowered the
see-level to revelation of continuous presence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
dual state. It is only on occasion that the improvement
is sufficient for the thing when at its feeblest to loom
thus above the horizon of certainty; yet at such moments
of a rise in the seeing it is enough to allow it
to be glimpsed. Thus it fared with the Adamas at the
opposition of 1903, with the Gigas, and with many
another in years gone by. Separation has come with
training and generally in the case of the wider doubles,
which leads one to infer that ease of resolution is largely
responsible for assurance of the permanency of the dual
state. Perplexing exceptions, however, remain, so
that it is possible at present only to predicate the
principal of most of the double canals but not of all.
Leaving the exceptions out of account for the moment,
we pass to those general characteristics which are intimately
linked with what has just been said.</p>

<p class='c008' >Inasmuch as the act of getting into a state antedates
the fact of being there, it is logical to let the description
of the first precede. An account of the process of gemination
may thus suitably come before that of its result.</p>

<p class='c008' >Flux, affecting the double canals in whole or part,
is the cause of the apparent gemination. According
as the flux is partitive or total is a single or a dual state
produced. At the depth of its inconspicuousness the
canal may cease to be visible at all; this occurs when
both lines fade out. On the other hand, the one line
may outfade the other, and we are presented with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
seemingly single canal, at this its minimum showing.
In such seasons of debility the one line may appear and
the other not, or occasionally the other show and the one
not, according to the air waves of the moment. It is
at these times that the double simulates a single canal,
and unless well seen and carefully watched might easily
masquerade successfully as such. The Hiddekel in the
depth of its dead season is peculiarly given to this alternately
partitive presentation. As the flux comes on,
one or both lines feel it. If one only we are likely to
have a confused canal; if both, a difficult double. The
strength of the lines increases until at last both attain
their maximum, and the canal stands revealed an unmistakable
pair, the two lines paralleling one another
in appearance as in position.</p>

<p class='c008' >At the canal’s maximum and minimum the equality
of its two constituents is chiefly to be remarked, though
it occurs on other occasions as well. But, what is significant,
when the two differ it is always the same one that
outdoes its fellow. It may be the right-hand twin in
one pair, the left-hand one in another; but whichever
it be, for the particular canal its preëminence is invariable.
It is this canal which, except for adventitious
help or hindrance from the air-waves, alone shows
when the double assumes the seemingly single state.
We may therefore call it the original canal, the other
being dubbed the duplicate. In some cases it has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
possible to decide which is which. It might seem at
first sight as if this point should always be ascertainable.
But the determination is more dilemmic than appears,
not from any difficulty in seeing the canal, but from the
absence of distinguishing earmark at its end. In a
long stretch of commonplace coast, the precise point of
embouchure of a solitary canal cannot be so certainly
fixed as to be decisive later between two which show
close together in the same locality. It is only where
some landmark points the canal’s terminal that the
problem admits of definite solution. This telltale
tag may be a bay like the Margaritifer Sinus, or double
gulfs like the Sabaeus Sinus, or portions of a marking
not too large to permit of partitive location like the
Mare Acidalium, or a canal connection like the Tacazze
which prolongs the one line and not the other. In these
and similar instances the two lines become capable of
identification, and in such manner have been found
those comprised in the following list:—</p>

In this list of originals the canals stand chronologically
marshaled according to date of detection.
The Phison and Euphrates were the first to permit of
intertwin identification in 1894, while the Jamuna and
Ganges were the last to be added to the column in 1905.
The list is not long, though the time taken to compile it
was. In the case of the Ganges and the Jamuna, for
example, although suspected for some time on theoretic
grounds, it was only at the opposition just passed
that the fact was observationally established. In
his <cite>Memoria</cite> V, Schiaparelli has a list of similar detection,
and if the present list be compared with his, the
two having been independently made, the concordance
of the result will prove striking, corroborative as it is
of both. For the necessary observations are very
difficult.</p>

<p class='c008' >Having thus realized the original by means of its
superior showing, and then identified it by its position,
it is suggestive to discover that the duplicate betrays
its subordinate character, not only by its relative insignificance,
but by its secondary position as well. The
original always takes its departure from some well-marked
bay, seemingly designated by nature as a departure-point,
or from a caret belonging clearly to itself;
the adjunct, on the other hand, leaves from some neighboring
undistinguished spot, as in the case of the additional
Djihoun, or makes use of a neighbor’s caret, as in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
the case of the second Phison and the supplementary
Euphrates. In either case it plays something of the
part of an afterthought; and yet the postscript when
finished reads as an integral part of the letter. An
example will serve to make the connection evident while
leaving the character of the connection as cryptic as
ever.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the long stretch of Aerial coastline bounding the
Mare Icarium, which sweeps with the curve of a foretime
beach from the Hammonis Cornu to the tip of
the Edom Promontory, there stand halfway down its
far-away seeming sea-front two little nicks or indentations.
Even in poor seeing they serve to darken this
part of the coast while in good definition they come out
as miniature caret-like bays. They are the Portus
Sigaei, and mark the spots where the Phison and the
Euphrates respectively leave the coast. About four
degrees apart, the eastern makes embouchure to the
original Phison, the western to the original Euphrates,
and each in some mysterious manner is associated not
only in position but in action with the canal itself.
In the single state each canal leaves the Mare from
this its own caret, the Phison proceeding thence northeast
down the disk, the Euphrates nearly due north,
so that starting four degrees apart at the south they
are forty degrees asunder at their northern termini.
Clearly at these latter points they are not even neighbors,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
and except for the accident of close approach at
their other ends have nothing in common anywhere.
And yet when gemination takes place a curious thing
occurs: each borrows its neighbor’s terminal as departure-point
for its own duplicate canal. Having thus
got its base the replica proceeds to parallel its own
original canal without the least reference to the other
canal whose own caret it has so cuckoo-wise appropriated.
What
the Phison thus
does to the Euphrates,
the Euphrates
returns
the compliment
by doing to the
Phison. In this
manner is produced an interrelation which suggests,
without necessarily being, an original community of
interest; suggests it on its face and yet appears to be
rather of the nature of an adaptation to subsequent
purposes of a something aboriginally there.</p>

<p class='re-caption'><i>June. 1903.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >That such latter-day appropriation is the fact is
clearly hinted by the behavior of another understudy
of an original canal, in this case the duplicate of the
Djihoun, which in consequence of the position of its
original finds no neighboring embouchure already
convenient to its use. The single or original Djihoun
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
leaves the tip of the needle-pointed Margaritifer Sinus,
which serves a like end to the Oxus and the Indus, both
single canals. The Sinus is itself a single bay, and so
large that for many degrees its shores on both sides converge
smoothly to their sharp apex. Because of this
probably, the coast in the immediate neighborhood is
without canal connection, no canal being known along
either side till one reaches the Hydraotes at the Aromaticum
Promontorium, which marks the western limit
of the gulf. The consequence is that when the Djihoun
doubles, the duplicate canal, not having any terminus
ready to its hand, has to make one for itself
by simply running into the Margaritifer Sinus, some
distance up its eastern side. It thus advertises its adjunctival
character, and at the same time the general
fact that a neighbor’s terminus, though used from preference,
when convenient, is not an essential in the process.
Gemination occurs of its own initiative, but is conditioned
by convenience.</p>

<p class='c008' >Whether one canal shows thus to the exclusion of the
other, or whether both stand so confused as not to be
told apart, the fact remains that the double is not always
recognizable as such. If we turn to the list of the
doubles on page <a href='#Page_222'>222</a>, we shall note that the same canals
were not always seen in the dual condition at successive
oppositions. Some, indeed, are so emphatically of the
habit as to appear year after year in a paired state, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
others are not so constant to their possibilities. Now,
when it is remembered that at different oppositions we
view Mars at diverse seasons of its tropical year, we see
that this means that the phenomenon is seasonal;
and furthermore that its exhibition depends upon the
canal’s position. Gemination, like the showing or non-showing
of the single canal, is conditioned by the place
of the canal upon the planet.</p>

<h3 class='c029'>III</h3>

<p class='c008' >Turning from such generic characteristics to more
specific traits, the first thing to strike an attentive observer
is that the doubles differ in width; that they are
not mensurably alike in the property they hold in common
of being paired. In some the twin lines are obviously
farther apart than in others, and the relation
persists however repeated the observations. Of two
doubles the one will always surpass its fellow. This
contrasted individuality first struck me in the Phison
and the Euphrates; and from the first moment at
which these doubles showed as such. The Phison pair
seemed perceptibly the narrower of the two. A like
distinction was evident at the next opposition and
the next; in fact, at every succeeding one to the
present day. Nor was the recognition of the fact
confined to me. If we turn to Schiaparelli’s Memoriae
we shall find that that master had registered the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
idiomatic width for the two canals from first to last
throughout his long series of records. The observation
thus made proved to apply to each and all of these
curious twins.</p>

<p class='c008' >Diversity in width for different doubles appears
plainly in drawings where more than one double is
depicted. As an example, two drawings are here
given in the text, made, the one on July 13, 1905, λ15°,
and the other on July 20, λ313°. In them the Phison,
Euphrates, Djihoun, and Thoth appear contrasted as
unmistakably as either of them does with the single
canals apparent at the same time. That this drawing
is typical is borne out by all the best measures of the
several doubles as seen at successive oppositions, and
marshaled in the subjoined list. How truly individual
the quality is stands proved by the relative values in
different years which are even more accordant than the
absolute ones.</p>

Here we have widths ranging from eleven degrees to
two. The widths given are those when the canal was at
or sufficiently near its full strength, and are measured
from the centres of the constituents. We notice two
points: the agreement of the same canal with itself
and its systematic disagreement with others. But
what is especially to the point, if we compare the values
found at successive oppositions, we find that for different
canals the values agree in their difference. This
shows that each of these values is, in most cases if not
in all, a norm for that particular canal; a value distinctive
of it and to which it either absolutely or relatively
conforms. In other words, the width of the
gemination is a personal peculiarity of the particular
canal, as much an idiosyncrasy of it as its position on
the planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >Two general classes may be distinguished; those up
to about five degrees in width apart and those above
this figure. Whether such very widely separated lines
as go to make up the second class, such as the Nilokeras
I and II, constitutes a double is a debatable point.
Schiaparelli thought they did, and so classed them.
To me it did not at first occur so to consider them,
and in some instances, such as the Helicon I and
II, later observations seem to justify the omission.
With the Nilokeras I and II the outcome seems the
other way. The reasons for distrust of a physical relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
between the constituents is not so much the distance
separating them, nor any lack of parallelism, as
the self-sufficient manner in which they show alone.
Even this, however, tends to be recognized in the narrower
pairs as they come to be better seen. It may
be that width alone is wholly competent to selective
showing. For the farther apart two lines are on the
planet, the more opportunity is afforded the air waves
to disclose the one without the other, a relative revelation
which is constantly happening to detail in different
parts of the disk. As long as any doubt exists of a
physical community of interest, it seems best to distinguish
such possibly merely parallel canals by suffixed
numerals.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of this class of doubles is the Nilokeras I and II.
So wide is it that Mr. Lampland succeeded in photographing
it as such, the two constituents showing well
separated, and if it prove a true double it will be the
first Martian double to leave its impress on a sensitive
plate. Although separated by four hundred miles of
territory, the two lines are parallel so far as observation
can detect, which, of course, is not so very easy
with the lines so far apart. In the country between
one crosswise canal certainly lies, the Phryxus, and
much shading thus far unaccounted for. Recent discoveries,
however, point to the cause of such shading as
lines imperfectly seen. For in some cases the lines
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
have actually disclosed themselves, and warrant us in
believing that it is only imperfect seeing that keeps the
others hid. Of the pair the Nilokeras I is itself double,
curiously reproducing what sometimes is seen in the
case of double stars, one of whose components turns
out to be itself a binary. The second line of the Nilokeras
I lies close to its primary on the north, and was on
the only occasion of its detection the merest of gossamers,
while the Nilokeras I itself stood out strong and
dark. Thus do these Martian details increase and multiply
in intricacy the better the seeing brings them out.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the case of the other doubles, the doubles proper
so to speak, there is every indication of a physical bond
between the pair. What that bond may be is another
matter and seems to be of different divulging, according
to the particular instance. At one end of the subject,
both as the widest of these doubles and one of the most
important, stands the Ganges. The components of
the canal are 5°.1 apart. This great width, joined to
the fact of scant extension, gives the canal a stocky
aspect, its breadth being but one sixth of its length.
Its width draws attention to it while the phenomena
it exhibits intrigue curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008' >As early as the first opposition of my observations
in 1894, the canal, as it underwent the process of
doubling, showed phases of peculiarity. It was first
caught by me as a double over toward the terminator,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
or fading edge of the disk; then as it was brought nearer
the centre by the gaining upon the longitudes, showed
as a broad swath of shading of a width apparently equal
to any it later exhibited. In this appearance it continued
for some months, and then in October began to
show a clarification toward the centre. Once started,
the lightening of its midway advanced till at last, on
November 13, it stood out an unmistakable double, the
two lines standing where the edges of the swath had
previously been. Had the observations here been all
that one could wish, the method of gemination would
have been certain and of great interest. Unfortunately,
the observations left much to be desired, and those repeated
in 1896-1897 and 1901 were of like doubtfulness.
A period of swarthy confusion preceded the
plainly dual state, but whether the double simply
clarified or widened as well it was not possible to assure
one’s self. That the canal exhibited plainly the effects
of seasonal development was as unmistakable as the
steps themselves were open to ambiguity. In 1903
the canal was at its minimum and hardly to be made
out. It seemed then to show an actual change in
width coincident with alteration of visibility. But
this, too, could not be predicated with certainty. It
was also surmisable that the westernmost line was
the one from which the development proceeded.</p>

<p class='c008' >In 1905 much more was made out about it, training
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
in the subject and increased proximity of the planet
contributing to the result. It now became clear to
me that the canal did develop from the western side;
for the western edge made
a dark line of definite boundary
from which shading proceeded
to the eastern side,
where it faded almost imperceptibly
off with no defined
line to mark its limit. That
this shading gradually darkened
was evident, but that
when it could be seen at all it extended to the extreme
limit of the eventual double, restricted the
character if not the fact of an actual widening. At
this opposition, too, the canal passed through its
period of minimum visibility and was then seen,
whenever it could be caught, as a confused swath of
full width. In the case of this canal, then, a widening
in the sense of a bodily separation of two lines
seems inadmissible. On the other hand, the gradual
darkening of the swath, and especially the advance of
the darkening from the western side, points to an
interesting process there taking place.</p>

<p class='c008' >At the opposite end of the series stands the Djihoun.
As the Ganges is the widest of the instantly impressive
doubles, so the Djihoun is the narrowest the eye has so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
far been able to make out. Only two fifths of the
width of the Ganges pair, this slender double is very
nearly at the limit of resolvability. So well proportioned
are its lines to the
space between them, however,
that in ease of recognition
it surpasses many wider
pairs. In form, too, it is distinctive,
turning by a graceful
curve the trend of the
Margaritifer Sinus into the
Lucus Ismenius. With its
fundamental branch—the northern of the two—it
joins what is evidently the main line of the Protonilus—also
the northern one—to the Margaritifer
Sinus’s tip.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Djihoun, the narrowest double.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >It differs from the Ganges in some other important
particulars besides width. In its case no band of shading
distinguishes it at any time. It has always been
two lines whenever it has been seen other than as a
single penciling; the only confusion about it being
evidently our own atmosphere’s affair. These two
lines, furthermore, have showed, within the errors of
observation, always the same distance apart. So that
not only no change of intercommunication between the
lines but no change in their places apparently occurs.</p>

<p class='c008' >Between these extremes in width, two hundred miles
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
more or less for the Ganges and seventy-five miles for
the Djihoun, the distance parting the pairs of most of
the double canals lies. From 3° to 3°.2 on the planet
may be taken as that of the average; the degrees denoting
latitudinal ones on the surface of Mars, the length
of which is equal to thirty-seven of our English statute
miles.</p>

<p class='c008' >Most of the canals conform apparently to the type
of the Djihoun rather than to that of the Ganges.
Careful consideration of them fails to find any increase
or decrease of distance, between the pairs of the same
canal at different times, which cannot be referred to
errors inevitable to observation of such minute detail.
In short, the double is made by the addition of a second
line in a particular position and not by a growth
out to it of a line coincident to begin with with the first.</p>

<p class='c008' >I have said that the average width between the two
lines of the doubles was about 3°. It must not be
supposed that this average width denotes anything
more than an average; or, in other words, that it denotes
anything in the nature of a norm. The remark
is important in view of a suggestion which I have heard
made that we have here a system based on fundamental
Martian units, in which, or in multiples of which, the
dimensions of the canals are implicitly expressed. Such,
however, does not seem to be the case. In some instances,
indeed, we have certain evidence to the contrary
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
and that the width of the double is conditioned
solely by antecedent place. The Phison and Euphrates
offer a case in point. These two important arteries
in duplicate leave, as we saw, from two carets in the
Mare Icarium, the Portus Sigaei, held in common tenancy
by both. Each pair then proceeds down the disk
inclined at its own particular angle to the meridian in
order to reach by a great circle course a certain spot;
the Pseboas Lucus in one case, the Luci Ismenii in the
other. As one of these angles is thirty-five degrees
while the other is only three, they must, from the
circumstances of their setting out, have not only
different widths, but widths determinately different in
advance, since each is, roughly speaking, foreshortened
by the degree of divergence from the meridian. The
one, therefore, must be about four degrees to the other’s
something less than three and a half. This is what they
actually are as determined by measurement from observation.
That the calculated value agrees with that
found from observation helps certify to a community
of starting-points, but it completely does away with
comprehensive design in the question of their widths.
For if the one were so settled, the other could not be.</p>

<p class='c008' >Indeed, the next example seems to deny it to
both. This example occurs, too, not far away from
the scene of the first, in the twin bays of the Sabaeus
Sinus, from which depart, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</span></i>, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_232' id='Page_232'>232</a></span>
double Hiddekel and the two Gihon. These twin
gulfs bear so little imprint of being other than natural
formations, that they have been universally and very
likely quite rightly taken for such ever since Dawes
discovered them in 1859, long
before things like canals were
dreamed of. It is strange
that when the Hiddekel and
the Gihon were found by me
to be double in 1897, with a
branch of both leading from
each bay, the connection between
the sceptically scouted
doubles and the thoroughly
believed-in bays should have been apparent. For to
link a ghost to materiality, if it does not discredit
the materiality, serves to substantialize the ghost.
Furthermore, it shows that in this case neither the
one double nor the other can have had its width
engineered on any preconceived scale, unless the
twin bays be themselves so accounted for. So that
it seems useless to seek for cryptic standards in the
canals or to think to find them a measure of value
from the fact of their being a medium of exchange.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008' >A third instance of the same thing in the case of the
Ganges and the Jamuna was proved at the last opposition
after having long been suspected without my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
being able to make sure of it. These instances, taken
in connection with the wide range of values in the
widths presented by different canals, serve to show
that the distance between the twin lines is an individual
characteristic of the particular canal, and further to
point to its cause, in some cases certainly and possibly
in all, as topographical. The duplicate line makes a
convenience of a neighbor, and suits its distance from
its fellow to friendly feasibility. To cut a ‘canal’ to
conform to the country seems logical if not obligatory,
and quite in keeping with the nomenclature of
the subject; but here the starting-point appears to be
the only thing considered—the canal once safely
launched being left to shift, or rather not shift, for itself.</p>

<h3 class='c029'>IV</h3>

<p class='c008' >Topography thus introduced to our notice for its
effect on the breadth of the doubles proves upon inspection
to be of extended application to the whole subject.
Examined for position these canals turn out to
have something to say for themselves bearing on the
question of their origin and office.</p>

<p class='c008' >With regard to position, probably the first query to
suggest itself to an investigator to ask is of the direction
in which they run. Is there a preponderance manifest
in them for one direction over another? Do they
show an inclination to the vertical, to the horizontal,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
or to some tilt between? To answer this we may box
the compass, and taking the four cardinal points with
the twelve next most important points between for
sectional division segregate the doubles according to
their individual trend. As we have no means of determining
in which sense any direction is to be taken,—if
indeed it is not to be taken alternately in each,—we
get eight compartments into one or the other of which
all the doubles must fall. This they do in the following
manner:—</p>

<p class='c016' >a fairly equable division in direction. A trend to the
westward would be given a particle descending from
the north to the equator by the planet’s rotation, thus
turning it southwesterly; and one to the west to a
particle travelling equatorwards from the south, turning
it northwesterly. As the doubles lie in the northern
hemisphere, either in whole or part, to the extent of
93%, this might account for the preponderating tilt to
the east of north and west of south exhibited by them.
It would correspond with the lines of flow.</p>

<p class='c008' >To see whether this be so we will take only those
double canals that lie exclusively in the northern and
southern hemispheres respectively, and note those in

the former that trend to the west of south as against
those that run to the east of it, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i> in the
southern. In the northern the proportion of the
westerly to the easterly ones is 17 to 4; in the southern,
1 to 0 the other way.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of those whose course is common to both hemispheres
we find for the ratio of the southwesterly to the southeasterly
8 to 7. But the proportion of the course of
these canals in the two hemispheres is on the side of
this same ratio.</p>

<p class='c008' >From their direction we now pass to consideration
of their distribution in longitude. It appears that
some meridians are more favored than others. The
hemisphere which has the Syrtis Major for centre is
more prolific in them than its antipodes. From longitude
80° to 200° there are ten doubles, from 200° to
320° twenty-four, and from 320° to 80° seventeen; or,
roughly, in the proportion of 2, 5, and 3. That
this distribution means anything by itself is doubtful;
it is much more likely to be a general topographical
consequence of their distribution in another direction,
which proves to be highly significant and which we
shall now expose—that of latitude.</p>

<p class='c008' >From this tabulating of them it is apparent that the
doubles are practically confined to the zones within
forty degrees of the equator. Only 7% of them straggle
farther north than this, while above 63° north latitude
and 35° south latitude there are none. Such a distribution
is not in proportion to the areas of the zones,
which though diminishing toward the poles do so
at no such rate. The surface included between the
equator and 40° of latitude is 65% of the hemisphere,
whereas the fraction of the number of doubles found
there is 93%. The doubles are, then, an equatorial
feature of the planet, confined to the tropic and temperate
belts.</p>

<p class='c008' >To perceive the tropical character of the doubles in
another way we have but to consider the zonal distribution
of the single canals. Unlike the former the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
latter do not thin out as one advances toward the poles;
since in the arctic regions single canals bemesh the surface
as meticulously as elsewhere. It is only that they
there replace the doubles; or, not to put the cart before
the horse, it is the doubles that in part replace the singles
in the tropics. And that this arrangement has something
physical behind it by way of cause is curiously
shown by two canals, the Arnon and the Kison, which
are neither of the one kind nor yet the other, but a
cross between the two. For the Arnon and the Kison
are convergent doubles; the two lines of the Kison
leaving a common point at the edge of the polar cap
and separating as they travel south, while the two
Arnon take up and continue the divergence, connecting
at last with the parallel pair of the Euphrates.
These canals thus make transition between the true
doubles and the true singles, and may be looked upon
as endowed with the potentialities of both. From
their association with the double Euphrates, it is clear
that the transition between the two forms is not only
formal but physical, and that the stopping of the dual
condition at the fortieth parallel is not the outcome
of chance.</p>

<p class='c008' >It may occur to the thoughtful that the doubles appear
confined to the more tropical portions of the planet
because of a better presentation of those zones, the
reader supposing the planet to be seen axised perpendicularly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
to the plane of sight, as geographies represent
the earth’s globe. The supposition, however, is erroneous.
We sometimes see the planet so, but more often
not. Such is the tilt of the Martian axis to the plane
of the Martian ecliptic that the different zones are
rarely seen on an even keel, so to speak, their aspects
shifting totally from one opposition to another. What
shows in mid-disk on one occasion may be forty-eight
degrees removed from it at another, a distance
amounting to three-quarters of the way from apparent
equator to apparent pole.</p>

<p class='c008' >Thus the double canals are for some intrinsic reason
equatorial features of the planet as opposed to polar
ones. And this not simply because of greater space
there. Duality is a result of conditions intrinsic to
the several localities. What the cause may be is related
to the character of the things themselves, which
we shall later consider. For the moment we may note
that the fact disposes quietly of the diplopic theory
of their manufacture. For, for diplopic doubles to
show such respect for the equator would betoken a
courtesy in them to be commended of Sydney Smith.</p>

<p class='c008' >But this is not their only geographic bias. In addition
to not being partial to the poles, the double canals
show a certain exclusiveness toward the dark areas
generally. Not only do they avoid the arctic and antarctic
zones entirely, but they largely shun the blue-green
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
regions. In these but two suspicions of doubles
occur, in the Aonium Sinus, although single canals
there are as numerous as anywhere else on the planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nevertheless, although they avoid running through
them, they run from them in a manner that is marked.
Proceeding from the great diaphragm are no less than
28 out of the 53 doubles. Connecting directly with
these are 17 more; while the remaining 8 are also associated
through the intermediarism of dark areas, the
Solis Lacus and the Trivium.</p>

<p class='c008' >In like relation to dark regions, they are limited on
the north by the Mare Acidalium, the Propontis, the
Wedge of Casius and their interconnecting bands, the
Pierius, Callirrhoe, Helicon. In this manner do they
form a broad girdle round the planet’s waist, leaving
the polar extremities bare.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c015'     >Seventeen years after the recognition of the
canals in the light regions occurred another important
event, the discovery of a similar set in the dark
ones. The detection of these markings in the dark
areas was a more difficult feat than the perceiving of
those in the light, and in consequence was later accomplished.
Also was it one where recognition came by
degrees.</p>

<p class='c008' >I have previously pointed out what this discovery
did for the seas—nothing less than the taking away
of their character in a generally convincing manner.
To one who had carefully considered the matter,
the seas had indeed already lost it, as was shown in
Chapter X, but to those who had not these canals
presented a very instant proof of the fact.</p>

<p class='c008' >From such not wholly supererogatory service they
went on to furnish unlooked-for help in other directions.
Their discovery showed in the first place that no part
of the planet’s surface was free from canal triangulation.</p>

<p class='c008' >But it did more than this. For these canals in the
dark regions left the edge of the ‘continents’ at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
very points where the canals of the light regions entered
them, which fact proved for them a community of
interest with the latter. Such continuation was highly
significant, since it linked the two together into a single
system, compassing the whole surface of the planet.
Starting from the places where the light-region canals
come out upon the great girdle of seas that stretches all
round the planet, most of the new canals headed toward
the passes between the islands south, as nearly polewards
as circumstances of local topography would permit.
In the broader expanses of the Syrtis Major and
the Mare Erythraeum, besides main arteries others
went to spots in their midst after the same fashion
as those of the light regions. These spots differed in
no way apparently from their fellow oases elsewhere.
From a spot in the centre of the Syrtis three great lines
thus traveled south: the Dosaron, heading straight
up the Syrtis on the meridian till it struck the northernmost
point of Hellas; the Orosines, inclined more to
the right, passing through the dark channel to the west
of that land and so proceeding south; and lastly the
Erymanthus turning eastward till it brought up finally
at the Hesperidum Lucus. Where, on the other hand,
the long chain of lighter land, called by Schiaparelli
islands, and stretching from the Solis Lacus region westward
to Hellas, offered only here and there an exit,
the canals made for these exits. The canals in the Mare
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_245' id='Page_245'>245</a></span>
Sirenum, the Mare Cimmerium, and the Mare Tyrrhenum
struck more or less diagonally across those seas from
their northern termini to the entrances of the straits
between the islands, thus lacing the seas in the way a
sail is rolled to its spar. From the exact manner in
which they connected with the light-region canals they
proved the two to be part and parcel of one system,
which in its extension was planet-wide and therefore
proportionately important. Whatever of strange interest
the curious characteristics of the canals themselves
suggested was now greatly increased by this addition;
for the solidarity of the phenomenon affected the
cogency of any argument derived from it.</p>

<p class='c008' >In 1894 only the dark areas of the southern hemisphere
were found to be thus laced with lines. For then
so great was the tilt of the planet’s south pole toward
the earth, that while those zones were well displayed
the dark patches of the northern hemisphere were more
or less hull-down over the disk’s northern horizon.</p>

<p class='c008' >Contrast was the open sesame to their detection.
When the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> show dark, the lines are lost in the
sombreness of the background. As the maria lighten
the lines come out. Such was amply witnessed by
the effect in 1894 and 1896. In 1894 I found it impossible
to perceive them, except where the Padargus
crossed Atlantis, for the hue of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> themselves
was then very dark. In 1896, on the other hand, I saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
them without difficulty. What is also of interest: so
soon as seen they appeared small, without haziness
or distention.</p>

<p class='c008' >As the oppositions succeeded one another the northern
regions rose into view, and with their appearance
came the detection in them of the same phenomena.
No large dark areas like the diaphragm exist there, but
the smaller patches of blue-green which bestrew them
proved to be similarly meshed. At first canals were
evident upon their peripheries, contouring them about;
then the bodies themselves of the patches showed grid-ironed
by lines.</p>

<p class='c008' >The Mare Acidalium with its adjuncts, the Lucus
Niliacus on the south and the Lacus Hyperboreus on
the north, thus stood out in 1901. On a particularly
good evening of definition at the end of May, the Mare
suddenly made background for a sunburst of dark rays,
six of them in all radiating from a point between it and
the Lacus Hyperboreus. Considering how sombre the
Mare was at the time, this was as remarkable a vision
as it was striking to see. Although at the moment
the sight was of the nature of a revelation, these lines
have been amply verified since, as the Martian season
has proved more propitious.</p>

<p class='c008' >Similar decipherment has befallen all the other
patches of blue-green in the northern hemisphere;
these having shown themselves first circumscribed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
then traversed by canals. Interesting instances were
the Wedge of Casius and the Propontis. These markings,
first perceived years ago as mere patches of shading,
then partially resolved by Schiaparelli, now stood
revealed as a perfect network of lines and spots. So
many of both kinds of their
detail occupied the ground
that to identify them all was
matter of exceeding difficulty.
The outcome is shown in the
diagrammatic representations
opposite and on page <a href='#Page_256'>256</a>.
These drawings disclose better than any description
the mass of detail of which the patches are in reality
composed, and serve to convey an idea of the complexity
involved. If the general canal system <a id='seem'></a>seems
intricate, here is something which exceeds that as
much again.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>The Propontis, 1905..</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The extension in this manner of the curious triangulation
of the light areas into and through all the
dark areas as well, by thus spreading the field of its
operations over both terranes complexioned so unlike,
greatly increases the cogency of the deduction that this
detail is of later origin than the background upon which
it rests. That the mesh of lines covers not only the
ochre stretches of the disk, but the blue-green parts as
well, makes it still more certain that it is not a simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
physical outcome of the fundamental forces that
featured the planet’s face. For in that case it could
not with such absolute impartiality involve both alike.
Thus here, again, we find corroboration by later observations
of what earlier ones established.</p>

<p class='c008' >A last link in the chain of canal sequences remains
to be recorded. Just as the lines in the dark regions
continued those in the light, so they themselves turned
out to be similarly prolonged and in no less suggestive
a manner. For when the north polar zone came to be
displayed, canals were evident there, continuing those
in the other zones and running at their northern ends
into dark spots at the edge of the polar cap. Here,
then, we have the end of the whole system, or more
properly its origin, in the polar snows. The significance
of this will be seen from other phenomena, to a
consideration of which we now proceed.</p>

  <h2 id='ch20' class='c006'><span class='xlarge'>CHAPTER XX</span><br /> <br />OASES</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Next to be caught of the details of this most curious
network that meshes the surface of Mars was
a set of phenomena stranger even than the lines; to wit,
dark round dots standing at their intersections. More
difficult to make out than the lines, they were in consequence
detected thus later by fifteen years. Once
discovered, however, it became possible to trace their
unconscious recognition back in time. Thus Schiaparelli
told the writer in 1895, apropos of those found at
Flagstaff, that he had himself suspected them but could
not make sure. Some of them stand figured in his
<cite>Memoria Sesta</cite> dealing with the opposition of 1888, but
not published till 1899. In such posthumous recognition,
as one may call it, the spots repeated the history
of the canals. For Schiaparelli had himself pointed
out a similar preconscious visioning of the canals in
the delicate pencilings of Dawes and the streaks of
Lockyer, Kaiser, and Secchi, now translatable as representing
the Phison, the Euphrates, and half a dozen
other canals imperfectly seen. That both the canals
and the oases were thus sketched before they were seen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
well enough to be definitely discovered is to an unprejudiced
mind among their strongest credentials to
credit.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nor was Schiaparelli the sole person thus to get proof
before letter. One of their very earliest portrayals
appears in a drawing by Otto Boeddicker, made on
December 26, 1881, where the Pseboas Lucus is clearly
represented. In a still more imperfect manner some
of the spots had been adumbrated and their shadows
drawn long before that. Thus they may be deciphered
as the cause of patches drawn by Dawes in 1864,
though none of them were in any definite sense detected
till 1879, and only then so ill defined that their
true character was not apparent. As patches they are
still commonly seen at observatories where the observational
conditions are not of the best and the study
of the planet not systematically enough pursued to have
them disclose their true shape and size.</p>

<p class='c008' >The history of their detection is resumed in the
experience of the individual observer. During the
course of my own observations I have had occasion to
notice the several stages in recognition of the spots
which have marked their chronologic career. As with
the lines, three stages in the appearance of the spots
may be remarked: first, where the scattering of the
rays is so wide that dilution prevents anything from
being seen; second, where the commotion being less
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
the object appears as a gray patch; and third, where
in comparative quiet it condenses into a black dot.
For the two former our own air waves are to blame.
In coursing waves of condensation and rarefaction they
spread the image of the spot as they do that of the
canal. Then as the currents calm the spot shrinks
to its normal proportions, and in so doing darkens in
consequence of being less widely diffused. Thus the
evolution in perception which may take place in the
course of an hour for a particular observer represents
exactly what has occurred in the person of the race by
the improvement in observational methods and sites.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the spots, although wider than the canals, remained
longer hidden from human sight, is due to the
optico-physic fact that a tenuous line may be perceived
<em>owing to its length</em> when a dot of the same diameter
would be invisible. Summation of impressions is undoubtedly
the cause of this. The mere fact that a row
of retinal cones is struck, although each be but feebly
affected, is sufficient to raise the sum total into the
sphere of consciousness.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the second stage of their visibility, the spots are in
danger of mistake with the smaller true patches of sombre
hue which fleck the northern hemisphere of the
planet and from which they differ totally in kind, totally
so far as our present perception goes. Such true
patches consist of a groundwork of shading, upon which,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
indeed, are superposed the usual network of lines and
spots. Prominent as instances of them are the Trivium
Charontis, the Wedge of Casius, and the Mare Acidalium.
With patches of the sort the spots proper must not be
confounded.</p>

<p class='c008' >Close treading on the heels of the detection of lines
athwart the seas came the recognition of spots there
likewise. At the opposition of 1896-1897 the number
was added to; and so the tale has been steadily
increased. Their number as found at Flagstaff up to
the present time, that is, to the close of the opposition
of 1905, is 186; of which 121 lie in the light regions,
42 in the dark areas of the southern hemisphere, and
23 in the smaller sombre patches of the northern zones.</p>

<p class='c008' >From their relationships and behavior it became
apparent that the spots were not lakes but something
which answered much more nearly to oases.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of the spots three kinds may be distinguished: the
large, the little, and the less, if by the latter term it may
be permitted to denote what has but collateral claim
to be included and yet demands a certain recognition.
For though not spots like the others, the members of
the third class have certain traits in common with them
while differing radically in others.</p>

<p class='c008' >To the kind called large belong the greater number
of spots so far found upon the disk. They are large
only by comparison with the little. For they measure
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
according to my latest determinations but seventy-five
or one hundred miles in diameter; on the planet
some two degrees across. Sizable black pin-heads,
it is their tone that chiefly catches the eye, for they
are commonly the darkest markings on the disk.
Against the ochre stretches they appear black, and
even in the midst of the dark areas they stand out
almost as much contrasted with their surroundings
as these do with the light regions themselves. About
a hundred and forty are now known. Those in the
light areas were discovered first; those in the dark
regions being harder to see.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of this first kind are such spots as the Pseboas Lucus,
the Aquae Calidae, the Lacus Phoenicis, and the Novem
Viae; or, in English, the Grove of Pseboas, the Hot
Springs, the Phœnix Lake, and the Nine Ways, to mention
no more. That they bear dissimilar names implies
no dissimilarity in structure. The phenomena are all
remarkably alike, and clearly betoken one and the
same class of objects; differing between themselves
at most in size and importance.</p>

<p class='c008' >In form they all seem to be round. They certainly
appear so, and were it not that retinal images of small
areas tend to assume this shape might implicitly be
credited with being what they seem. The reason for
optical circularity probably resides in the shape of the
retinal cones and in their patterning into a mosaic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
floor. So that unless a sufficient number of cones be
struck the image takes on to consciousness a roughly
circular figure—whether it be so in fact or not. In
the present case, however, they seem to be too well
seen for self-deception of the sort.</p>

<p class='c008' >The little are distinguished from the large by being
pin-points instead of pin-heads. They are most minute;
from fifteen to twenty-five miles in diameter
only. That anything except size distinguishes the
two apart is from their look improbable. In color or
rather tone,—for distinctive color is of such minute
objects unpredicable,—they
would seem to be alike.
Such is also the case with
their distribution and detail
association.</p>

<p class='c008' >To the second class belong
the Fons Juventae,—Schiaparelli’s
Fountain of
Youth,—the Fons Immortalis
in Elysium in 1905, and the Gygaea Palus, besides
many more. These are all pin-points, just upon the
limit of vision, and noteworthy chiefly for being visible
at all. All those detected so far lie not very distant
from the equator, which may or may not be a matter of
accident. It is not one of perception, since this part
of the planet was not the best place for observation at
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
the time they were discovered. To make out one of
these little dots is a peculiarly pleasing bit of observation,
as it requires particularly good definition. One
might almost take them for fly-specks upon the image
did they not move with the disk. They have no perceptible
size and yet are clearly larger in diameter than
the canals which run into them; which proves how
very slender the latter must be.</p>

<p class='c008' >Very early in the detection of the spots it became
evident that they were not scattered haphazard over
the surface, but that on the contrary they were never
found except at the meeting-points of the lines. From
this it must not be supposed, as has been done, that the
spots are merely optical reinforcements of the lines at
their crossings due to the more crowded character
there of the lines themselves. That they are not such
is demonstrated by the existence of crossings where,
either temporarily or permanently, none appear;
which shows that they are far too well seen for any
such illusion about them to be possible. At these crossings
the lines traverse one another without thickening,
whether they be single or double lines. The spots,
on the other hand, are much wider than the lines,
giving a beaded look to the threads. In short, they
are the knots to the canal network. All the more important
junctions are characterized by their presence.
Such starred junctions are not confined to the ochre
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
regions; they dot the light and the dark areas with
equal impartiality, thus showing themselves to be independent
of the nature of the ground where large
stretches of country are concerned. On the other hand,
they appear to be unusually numerous in the smaller,
isolated, dark areas of the northern hemisphere, such
as the Trivium, the Mare Acidalium, the Propontis,
and the Wedge of Casius. Here they crowd; and one
cannot avoid the inference that their plentifulness in
these regions is not due to chance.</p>

<p class='c008' >To the large spots, those of the first class, fall the
places of intersection of the largest and most numerous
canals, while the little spots make termini to
fainter lines, ones that bear to them a like ratio of unimportance.
Spots and lines are thus connected not
simply in position but in size. The one is clearly
dependent on the other, the importance of the centre
being gauged by the magnitude of its communications.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
From the fact of association we now pass to the manner
of it, which is quite as remarkable. The position
of the spot relative to its tributary canals depends upon
the character of the connecting lines. If the canal be
single it runs, so far as may be judged, straight into
the middle of the oasis, or, in other words, the oasis
is symmetrically disposed about its end. This is true
of the greater number of the large spots and of all the
little ones, since the latter have as connections only
single canals.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the case of a double canal arriving at a spot, a different
and most curious dependence is observable. This
fact I first noticed in a general way at the opposition of
1896-1897, the initial appearance of it being presented
on September 30, 1896, by the Coloe Palus and the
Phison. It was again visible in the case of the spots
in the Trivium at the time the canals leading to that
place doubled in March, 1897. But the exact nature
of the phenomenon was not fully appreciated till
1903, when the thing was seen so well as to appear
cut on copper plate. It was this: the spot is exactly
embraced between the two arms of the double canal.
It is, moreover, seemingly perfectly round and just
fits in between the parallel lines. The Ascraeus Lucus
was the first spot that showed thus in association with
the double Gigas. Others followed suit in so showing,
several specimens presenting themselves so well as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
leave no doubt of the precise connection. The sight
presented by such a spot and its incasing double is a
beautiful bit of detail, perhaps the most beautiful so
far to be seen upon the Martian disk. The distinctness
with which it stands out on occasion suggests
a steel engraving,
and shows how
clear-cut the Martian
features really
are when our own
air ceases from
troubling and allows
them to be
at rest. Incidentally, we may note that this phenomenon
alone serves to disprove the diplopic theory
of the production of the double canals. For if a double
were a single line seen out of focus, any spot upon it
should be doubled too.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >It may seem to the reader as if what was seen
in 1903 was but an unimportant advance over the
observed phenomena of 1896-1897. Not so, however.
For with the earlier instances it was not possible
to be sure of the precise limits of the spot with regard
to the double. The Coloe Palus, on the one hand, did
not fill all the space apparently between the double
Phison; while the Lucus Ismenius more than did so
with the double Euphrates. To have set down the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
different appearances to insufficient definition would
have been a great mistake, as subsequent observation
has served to show. The Lucus Ismenius instances
this. In 1896-1897 it was seen terminating the Euphrates,
blocking all the space between the two lines
and extending a little upon either side of them. Now,
from its appearance in 1901 it was evident that the
effect had been produced by twin spots lying along
the Deuteronilus, the axis joining them being perpendicular
to the Euphrates. In 1903 the relation was
still better explained by what appeared then, when not
only did the two spots stand out, but the Euphrates
showed with a line running centrally into each.</p>

<p class='c008' >Although originally seen by Schiaparelli as a single
spot and so at first seen by me, better acquaintance
with the disk disclosed to both observers its really dual
character. As this pair has persisted through all three
of the most recent oppositions, it seems fairly certain
that it is always of this character, and more fitting,
therefore, to give it the plural appellative. This
is the single instance of a double oasis. There are
many that lie close together and might be taken as
such; but this is the only one where the connection is
intrinsic. According to measures of the drawings of
1905 extending through six presentations, the distance
between the twin oases is 4°.2.</p>

<p class='c008' >Their relation to the canals which run into them is of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
the most complicated description and of the most suggestive
character. For to the twin spots converge
no less than seven double canals, one wedge-shaped
pair and three single canals, a most goodly number of
communication lines. Four of the double canals run
into the oases with one line to each; these canals are
the Astaboras, the Naarmalcha, the Euphrates, and the
Hiddekel. Three doubles, the Protonilus, the Djihoun,
and the Deuteronilus, embrace the oases between their
two lines, while, in the singles, the canal connects with
one or other of the twins, as the case may be.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, there is method as to which of the doubles
shall straddle, which embrace, the two Ismenii. Those
which leave the place parallel
or nearly so to the direction
joining the Luci, inclose
them both; those of which
the setting forth is at an
angle to this direction depart,
each line of the pair, from
the eastern and the western
spot respectively.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Peculiar association of the Luci Ismenii with double canals.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Consider, now, the disposition
of these seven pairs of lines. All of them lie in
one semicircle about the Luci, beginning with the
Protonilus on the east and ending with the Deuteronilus
on the west. Furthermore, all follow approximately
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
arcs of great circles, except the Djihoun, and
all send one of their twin lines to one Lucus, one to
the other. The data are enough to make this statement
possible. Although the west line of the Naarmalcha
has not been caught entering its oasis, the east
one has been seen to enter the other, and the width of
the double shows that the west one must enter the
corresponding spot. In the case of the Astaboras the
double has only been observed as far as the Vexillum,
but the south line has continued on to the west
Ismenius, and here again the width makes it certain
that were the canal double throughout, the other line
must enter the east Ismenius. From the base line of
the Proto-Deuteronilus the inclinations of the seven
pairs are as follows:—</p>

<table class='c009' summary=''>

<p class='c016' >Now, the width between the two lines of the four canals
to the east increases regularly from the Protonilus
round; the Protonilus being the narrowest double, the
Astaboras the next, the Naarmalcha the next, and the
Euphrates the widest. And from the width between
the twin oases, it would seem that they severally enter
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
the centres of them. What takes place in the case of
the Hiddekel, which is wider than its tilt would imply,
and in the Djihoun,
which is
narrower, is not
so clear. But
that they enter
the oases in some
place is certain.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The spots make
common termini for all the canals of a given neighborhood.
In other words, canals converge to the
places occupied by the spots and do not cross haphazard
according to the laws of chance. Only one
instance exists where a spot fails to gather to itself
the whole sheaf of canals and even there it collects
all but two. This anomaly is the Pseboas Lucus.
The peculiarity of this oasis is that it lies not on,
but just off, the Protonilus. That it does so is exceeding
curious, considering that it is the sole example
of such extra-canaline position. Strictly speaking, it is
not the Protonilus but the point where the Protonilus
turns into the Nilosyrtis to which it stands thus neighboringly
aloof. And this may explain the anomaly.
For the Nilosyrtis has not the full geometric regularity
of the normal canal, and seems to have been
a more or less fundamental feature of the region.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
For the rest, the Lucus has the form and possesses
the canal connections appropriate to its state. It is
apparently round, and lies between the twin lines of the
Phison and also between those of the Vexillum.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not far from the Pseboas Lucus are to be found all
the examples of the third class of spots; for so far they
have not been observed outside of Aeria, a region peculiarly
peopled by double canals. With double canals
they are necessarily associated, inasmuch as they consist
of shading in the form of a square or parallelogram,
filling the deltas between two pairs that cross. Thus
have shown the Coloe Palus at the crossing of the double
Phison with the double Astaboras, and the Juturna
Fons where the double Sitacus traverses the double
Euphrates.</p>

<p class='c008' >At these same places a fourth kind is sometimes noticeable:
a four-square set of pin-points or a two-square
set of the same at the corners of the line-made parallelogram.
This kind may well be synchronous with the
third, though it has only been noticed at consecutive
presentations. The third, however, has no observed
dependence upon the first or second classes. And this
serves to make more probable the true objectivity
of the circular and the square figures respectively
shown by each.</p>

<p class='c008' >The spots apparent in the dark regions do not appreciably
differ in either size or shape from the bulk of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
those visible in the light. Equally with them they
seem to be round, small, and nearly black. They
would seem, too, in the great diaphragm—or larger
contiguous sombre region—to be equally plentifully
distributed.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_8 c015'     >Functionally related to the canal system,
and yet in look and location contrasted with its
other details, is a further set of markings, detected by
me in 1894, and reseen at subsequent oppositions
since, along the north border of the southern seas.
They lie upon what used to be thought the continental
coastline, the fringing edge of that almost
continuous band of shading that belts the Martian
globe throughout the southern subtropic zone and
called by Schiaparelli the great diaphragm. The terrane
lends itself to the appellative, forming, as it does,
a dark dividing strip of country between the brilliant
reddish-ochre hemisphere on the north and the half-toned
islands to the south of it. By Schiaparelli it
was thought to be one long Mediterranean, and though
its marine character is now disproved, that it lies
lower than the bright ochre regions is likely. To this
difference of level is probably due the peculiar phenomenon
which there manifested itself to careful scrutiny
in 1894. For it was there only that it occurred.</p>

<p class='c008' >The phenomenon in question consisted of nicks in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
the coastline, of triangular shape and filled with shading.
They occurred at intervals along it and were of
the general form of carets, such marks as one makes
in checking items down a list. Their position was always
where a canal debouched from the diaphragm
upon its career across the open continent. The canal
itself was by no means necessarily visible. On the
contrary, at first it was usually absent. Such was the
case with those marking the departure-points of the
Phison and Euphrates and of the Amenthes and
Lethes, which appeared, without being well defined,
from the moment the planet came to be scanned.</p>

<p class='c008' >One by one these carets stood out to view, punctuating
the points where canals later were to show or terminating
those that already existed. Strung thus with
them at intervals was the whole coastline of the diaphragm,
beginning with the Mare Icarium and stretching
round through the Mare Tyrrhenum, Mare Cimmerium,
Mare Sirenum, and Mare Erythraeum to the
Mare Icarium again. As the planet got nearer to the
earth their peculiar shape began to define itself, and it
was again in the case of those giving origin to the Phison
and Euphrates that the recognition came first. What
had appeared earlier simply as a spot now stood out
as two triangular notches, indenting the coast and giving
exit at their apices, the eastern one to the Phison, the
western to the Euphrates. These were the things,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
then, that had constituted the Portus Sigaeus of Schiaparelli.</p>

<p class='c008' >Commonly the carets lie at the bottom of well-marked
bays, as, for example, those terminating the Syrtis
Minor and the Sinus Titanum. But frequently they
are placed in the very midst of a long and otherwise
unaccented coast, as is the case in mid-course of the
Mare Cimmerium and the Mare Sirenum. Yet in no
instance is the thing unassociated with a canal. In
every case one or more canals leave the caret for their
long traverse down the disk.</p>

<p class='c008' >This is not their only canal connection. When the
canals in the dark regions came to be discovered, each
of them was found by me, as nearly as difficult observations
would permit, to be associated with the caret
upon its other side. Thus the lacing of the Mare Cimmerium
and Sirenum used them as its reeving-points.
Similarly those at the mouths of the Phison and Euphrates
did duty likewise to the Maesolus and the Ion.
In such manner the carets stood in dual relation to
canals; subserving a purpose to the light-region canals
on the one hand and to the dark-region ones on the
other. In a way the caret, then, holds the same position
toward the canals that do the spots in the light or dark
regions. Like them it is a canal-distribution point.
Unlike them, however, in shape it is triangular instead
of round, and we are piqued to inquire to what cause
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
it can owe its different contour. The answer seems to
lie in the character of the locality, not simply in its
complexion. For the spots in both the northern and
the southern dark patches are as circular as those standing
in the light, whether they lie in the centre or upon
the edges of them. The edges of the northern patches,
however, and the other sides of the southern ones do
not present the clear-cut character of the northern coast
of the diaphragm. Where they seem to be definitely
bounded they are so by darker canals. This hints
that their contours are not defined by antithesis of
level, while that of the northern coast of the great diaphragm
is. Difference of altitude is then concerned in
their constitution; the canal system here falls to a
lower level, and these triangular spots instead of round
ones are the result. Topographic only, such explanation
leads the way to a more teleologic one, and serves
even on first acquaintance to stir curiosity to some
satisfying cause.</p>

<p class='c008' >Suggestive in several ways for its resemblance to the
carets is another detail not far distant from the Portus
Sigaei, the twin-forked Sabaeus Sinus. Curiously
enough, this feature of Mars, which has been well
known and recognized ever since the eagle-eyed Dawes
detected it more than forty years ago, proves to be a
sort of connecting link between the main markings and
the details of more modern detection. The twin-forked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
Sabaeus Sinus, as its name implies, is of the
form of a double bay; was considered to be one in fact
so long as the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maria</span></i> were held to be seas. It straddles
the point of land which, called the Fastigium Aryn,
has been taken for the Greenwich of Martian longitudes.
Each ‘bay’—not in truth a bay at all—indents
the ochre in an acute triangle, from the tip of which
many canals proceed like the rays of a fan from a holding
hand. Both tips are darker than the main body
of the dark <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mare</span></i> from which they proceed. They thus
recall in general character the carets. They further
reproduce specifically the Portus Sigaei, for they give
origin to two doubles, the Gihon and the Hiddekel,
in exactly the same manner that the two nicks of the
Portus Sigaei do to the Phison and Euphrates. Nor
are their tips much farther apart than those of the
Portus, five degrees measuring the spread of the one
and four degrees that of the other respectively; the
reason for their earlier discovery lying in their greater
size. They thus perform the same office as the Portus
Sigaeus, are quite comparable to it in width, and differ
in shape only as a larger and more acute triangle differs
from a smaller and blunter one. Undreamt of by
Dawes and unheeded since, they were the first hint to
the world of the duality which forms so strangely pervasive
a feature of the canal system of the planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >Thus the carets stand connected with the canals
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
quite as intimately as the oases but in a significantly
different manner. For, in addition to their intermediary
standing between the light regions and the dark,
their relation to the doubles is peculiar. An instance is
offered by the double Euphrates and another by the
Ganges. The Euphrates, as we saw in Chapter XVIII,
leaves the Portus Sigaei at the south, one line leaving
each caret centrally, so that each caret is concerned only
with its own line and has no connection with its fellow.
At their northern ends both lines have similarly each
its own Lucus Ismenius. The like seems to be true of
the Ganges. Similarly the twin Titan, have each its
own. Such twin duty in the matter of doubles seems
to be the rule with the carets, even more so than with
the oases; and this is probably from the fact that the
coastline is of more limited extent than the interior.</p>

<p class='c008' >Altogether the carets offer to our inspection glosses
in finer print upon the general text of the canals.
Thought upon what they show takes us a step farther
toward the solution of the strange riddle of this other
world, a riddle which he who runs may not read, still
less scout, and which only reasoning, without prejudice
or partiality, can unravel.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Photography holds to-day a place of publicity
in the exposition of the stars. Directed by Draper
to the heavens thirty-four years ago, the camera recorded
then the first picture ever taken of the moon.
From this initial peering into celestial matters, practice
has progressed until now the dry plate constitutes one
of the most formidable engines in astronomic research.
Not most effectively, however, in the field which might
have been predicted. Beautiful as the lunar presentment
was, as a presentiment of what was coming, it
pointed astray. For it is not in lunar portrayal, superbly
as its crater walls in crescent chiaroscuro or its
crags that cast their tapering shadows athwart the dial
of its plains stand out in the latest photographs of our
satellite, that the camera’s greatest service has since
been done. Impressive as they are, these pictorial
triumphs are chiefly popular, and appeal on their face
to layman and scientist alike. Not in the nearest to
us of the orbs of heaven, but in the most remote has
celestial photography’s most prolific field been found
to lie. Its province has proved preëminently the stars,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
especially the farthest off, and that star-dust, the
nebulæ, from out of which the stars are made. Reason
for this explains at once its efficiency and its limitations.</p>

<p class='c008' >Its rival, of course, is the eye. It is as regards the
eye that its comparative merits or demerits stand to
be judged. Now, thus viewed, its superiority in one
respect is unquestionable; it simply states facts.
But though it cannot misinform, it can color its facts
by giving undue prominence to the effect of some rays
and suppressing the evidence of others, so that its
testimony is not, it must be remembered, always in
accord with that of human vision. Speaking broadly,
however, it is so little complicated a machine as to
register its results with more precision than the retina.
The evidence of the camera has thus one important
advantage over other astronomic documents: it is impersonally
trustworthy in what it states. Bias it has
none, and its mistakes are few. Imperfections, indeed,
affect it, but they are of purely physical occasion and
may be eliminated or accounted for as well by another
as by the photographer himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >In trustworthiness, then, so far as it goes, it stands
commended; not so much may be said of its ability.
This depends upon the work to which it is put. In certain
lines it asserts preëminence; in certain others it is
so far behind as to be out of the race. The reason for
both is one and the same, for, as the French would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
say: It has the faults of its quality. The very trait
that fits it for one function, bars it from the other.
This excellence is that by which the tortoise outstripped
the hare,—a plodding perseverance. Far less sensitive
than the retina the dry plate has one advantage over its
rival,—its action is cumulative. The eye sees all it can
in the twentieth of a second; after that its perception,
instead of increasing, is dulled, and no amount of
application will result in adding more. With the dry
plate it is the reverse. Time works for, not against it.
Within limits, themselves long, light affects it throughout
the period it stands exposed and, roughly speaking,
in direct ratio to the time elapsed. Thus the camera
is able to record stars no human eye has ever caught
and to register the structure of nebulæ the eye tries to
resolve in vain.</p>

<p class='c008' >Where illumination alone is concerned the camera
reigns supreme; not so when it comes to a question
of definition. Then by its speed and agility the eye
steps into its place, for the atmosphere is not the
void it could be wished, through which the light-waves
shoot at will. Pulsing athwart it are air-waves of
condensation and rarefaction that now obstruct, now
further, the passage of the ray. By the nimbleness of its
action the eye cunningly contrives to catch the good
moments among the poor and carry their message to the
brain. The dry plate by its slowness is impotent to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
follow. To register anything, it must take the bad with
the better to a complete confusion of detail. For the
air-waves throw the image first to one place and then
to another, to a blotting of both.</p>

<p class='c008' >All of which renders the stars, where lighting counts
for so much and form for so little, the peculiar province
of celestial photography. With the study of the surfaces
of the planets the exact contrary is the case. With
most of them illumination is already to be had in
abundance; definition it is that is desired. What succeeds
so excellently with the stars is here put to it to
do anything at all. At its best, the camera is hopelessly
behind the eye when it comes to the decipherment of
planetary detail. To say that the eye is ten times the
more perceptive is not to overstep the mark. To try,
therefore, here to supplant the eye by the camera
is time thrown away.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of scant importance to the expert in such matters as
Mars, there is a side of the subject in which service
might be hoped of it: that of elementary exposition.
Congenitally incapable of competing with the eye in
discovery, the most that, by any possibility, could be
looked for would be a recording of the coarser details
after the fact. For this reason it had long been a
purpose at Flagstaff to photograph some at least of
the canals. But the project seemed chimerical. To
get an image suitable at all some seconds of exposure
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
would be required, and during such time the shifting
air-waves would blur the very detail desired to be got.
It was a problem of essential premises mutually annihilative.
The more the would-be photographer should
avoid the one; the more he would fall into the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nevertheless the thing was tried in 1901. In 1903
the subject was taken up by Mr. Lampland, then new
at the observatory. The results were better than
those of two years before, the images more clear-cut
but still incommunicable of canals. Still they were
satisfactory enough to spur to increased endeavor, and
during the following interopposition preparations were
made to grapple with the planet as successfully as could
be devised at its next return. This happened in
May, 1905. It then showed a disk only 17′′ in diameter,
or 1/120 that of the moon,—and this disk Mr.
Lampland attacked with the 24-inch and a negative
amplificator that increased the focal length of the
former to 143 feet. At such focus the planet’s image
was received upon the plate. Everything that could
conduce to success had been put in requisition. To
this end of better definition the color curve of the objective
was first got, and for it a special color screen
constructed by Wallace. In spite of its name no achromatic
is so in fact, but brings rays of different tint to
different focus. The color curve shows where these
severally lie, and the color screen, a chemically tinted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
piece of glass, is to absorb all those which would blur
the image by having a different focus from the ones retained.
Next, all manner of plates were tried. For
in these again it was necessary to reconcile two contradictory
characters, a rapid plate and a well-defining
one. For the coarser the grain the speedier
the plate; and coarse grain disfigures the detail.
Both qualities on so small an image were obligatory
and yet both could not be got. Then the clock
had to be as smooth-running as possible. So by a suggestion
of Mr. Cogshall’s one was obtained that filled
this requisite, a new form of conical pendulum. Upon
this a further refinement was practiced. Ordinarily
clockwork is timed to follow the stars; this was altered
to follow the planet, and so keep it more nearly motionless
while its picture was being taken. Then the
device of capping down the telescope to suit the air-waves,
which had been found so effective to the bringing
out of fine detail, was put in practice. Lastly, all developers
were tried, and those found suited to the
finest work were used.</p>

<p class='c008' >Many pictures were taken on each plate one after
the other, both to vary the exposure and to catch such
good moments as might chance. Seven hundred images
were thus got in all; the days of best definition alone
being utilized. The eagerness with which the first
plate was scanned as it emerged from its last bath may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
be imagined, and the joy when on it some of the canals
could certainly be seen. There were the old configurations
of patches, the light areas and the dark, just
as they looked through the telescope, and never till
then otherwise seen of human eye, and there more marvelous
yet were the grosser of those lines that had so
piqued human curiosity, the canals of Mars. He who
ran might now read, so that he had some acquaintance
with photography. By Mr. Lampland’s thought, assiduity,
and skill, the seemingly impossible had been
done.</p>

<p class='c008' >After the initial success was thus assured, plates were
taken at other points around the planet and other well-known
features came out; “continents” and “seas,”
“canals” and “oases,” the curious geography of the
planet printed for the first time by itself in black and
white. By chance on one of the plates a temporal
event was found registered too, the first snowfall of the
season, the beginning of the new polar cap, seen visually
just before the plate happened to be put in and reproduced
by it unmistakably. Upon the many images
thirty-eight canals were counted in all, and one of them,
the Nilokeras, double. Thus did the canals at last
speak for their own reality themselves.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_8 c015'     >So far in our account of the phenomena we have
regarded the lines, the spots, and everything that
is theirs solely from the point of view of their appearance
at any one time. In other words, we have viewed
them only from a static standpoint. In this we have
followed the course of the facts, since in this way were
the canals first observed. We now come to a different
phase of the matter,—the important disclosure, with
continued looking, that these strange things show themselves
to be subject to change. That is, they take
on a kinematic character. This at once opens a fresh
field of inquiry concerning them and widens the horizon
of research. It increases the complexity of the problem,
but at the same time makes it more determinate.
For while it greatly augments the number of facts
which must be collected toward an explanation of
what the things are, these once acquired, it narrows
the solution which can apply to them.</p>

<p class='c008' >The fact of change in the Martian markings forces
itself upon any one who will diligently study the planet.
He will be inclined at first to attribute it to observational
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
mistakes of his own or his predecessor’s making,
preferably the latter. But eventually his own delineations
will prove irreconcilable with one another, and
he will then realize the injustice of his inference and
will put the cause, where indeed it rightly belongs, on
the things themselves. Confronted by this fact he will
the more fully appreciate how long and systematic
must be the study of him who would penetrate the
planet’s peculiarity. Just as the recognition of something
akin to seasonal change came to Schiaparelli, because
of his attending to the planet with an assiduity
unknown to his predecessors; so it became evident
that to learn the laws of these changes and from
them the meaning of the markings, there was necessary
as full and as continuous a record of them as it was possible
to obtain. For this end it was not enough to get
observations from time to time, however good these
might be, but to secure as nearly as might be a complete
succession of such, day after day, month after month,
and opposition after opposition. The outcome justified
the deduction. And it is specially gratifying to realize
that to no one have the method and the results thus
obtained appealed with more force than to Schiaparelli
himself.</p>

<p class='c008' >Perseverance in scanning the disk long after the
casual observer had considered it too far away for
observational purposes, resulted in Schiaparelli’s detection
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
of the canals, and this through a characteristic
of theirs destined to play a great part in their history,
their susceptibility to change. He tells us in his <cite>Memoria
I</cite> how Aeria and the adjoining regions showed
blank of any markings while the planet was near in 1877
and the disk large and well shown, and then how, to his
surprise, as the planet got farther away and the disk
shrank, lines began to come out in the region with unmistakable
certainty. Thus to the very variability
which had hidden them to others was due in Schiaparelli’s
hands their initial recognition.</p>

<p class='c008' >Flux affecting the canals was apparent from the
outset of my own observations. No less the subject
of transformation than the large dark regions was the
network of tenuous lines that overspread them. At
times they were very hard to make out, and then again
they were comparatively easy. Distance, instead
of rendering them more difficult, frequently did the
reverse. Nor was the matter one of veiling. Neither
our own atmosphere nor that of Mars showed itself
in any way responsible for their temporary disappearance.
It was not always when our atmospheric conditions
were best that the lines stood out most clearly,
and as to Martian meteorology there was no sign that
it had anything whatever to do with the obliteration.
Long before the canals were dreamt of, veiling by
Martian clouds or mist had been considered the cause
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
of those changes in the planet’s general features, which
are too extensive and deep-toned wholly to escape observation
even though none too clearly seen. It was
early evident to me that they were not the cause of
general topographic change, and equally clearly as
inoperative in those that affected the canals. In short,
nothing extrinsic to the canal caused its disappearance;
whatever the change was, its action lay intrinsic to the
canal itself.</p>

<p class='c008' >On occasion canals in whole regions appeared to be
blotted out. The most careful scrutiny would fail
to disclose them, where some time before they had been
perfectly clear. And this though distance was at its
minimum and definition at its best. Even the strongest
marked of the strange pencil lines would show at times
only as ghosts of their former selves, while for their more
delicate companions it taxed one’s faith to believe that
they could ever really have existed. Illumination
was invoked to account for this, and plays a part in the
effect undoubtedly. For at plumb opposition the centre
of the disk for two or three years has shown less
detail than before and after that event. This is probably
due not, as with the moon, to the withdrawal of
shadows, but to the greater glare to which the disk
is then subjected. But this is not the chief cause of
the change.</p>

<p class='c008' >Still more striking and unaccountable was the fact
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
that each canal had its own times and seasons for showing
or remaining hid. Each had its entrances upon the
scene and its exits from it.
What dated the one left
another unaffected. The
Nilokeras was to be seen
when the Chrysorrhoas was
invisible, and the Jamuna
perfectly evident when the
Indus could scarcely be
made out.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Seasonal changes seemed
the only thing to account
for the phenomena. And in
a general sense this was
undoubtedly the explanation.
To learn more about
the matter, to verify it if it
existed, and to particularize
it if possible, I determined to undertake an investigation
permitting of quantitative precision in the case.
A method of doing this occurred to me which would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
yield results deserving of consideration from the amount
of data upon which each was based and capable
of being compared with one another upon an equal
footing from which relative information could be derived.
It seemed wise to determine from the drawings
the degree of visibility of a given canal at
different seasons of the Martian year, and then to do
this for every important canal during the same period
of time. The great number of the drawings suggested
this use to which they might be put. For from a great
accumulation of data a set of statistics on the subject
could be secured in which accident or bias would be
largely eliminated and the telling effect of averages
make itself felt.</p>

<p class='c008' >To render this possible it was necessary that the
drawings should be alike numerous, consecutive, and
extended in time. These conditions were fulfilled by
the drawings made by me at the opposition of 1903.
Three hundred and seventy-two drawings had then
been secured, and they covered between them a period
of six months and a half. They were also as consecutive
as it was possible to secure. During a part of the
period the planet was seen and drawn at every twenty-four
hours, from April 5, namely, to May 26, or for forty-six
consecutive days. Though the rest of the time did
not equal this perfection, no great gap occurred, and
one hundred and forty-three nights were utilized in all.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
Furthermore, as these drawings were all made by one
man, the personal equation of the observer—a very
important source of deviation where drawings are to
be compared—was eliminated.</p>

<p class='c008' >But even this does not give an idea of the mass of
the data. For by the method employed about
100 drawings were used in the case of each canal,
and as 109 canals were examined this gave 10,900
separate determinations upon which the ultimate
result depended. That each of these determinations
was independent of the others will appear from a
description of the method itself on which the investigation
was conducted. To understand that method one
must begin a little way back.</p>

<p class='c008' >As the two planets, Mars and the Earth, turn on their
axes the parts of their surfaces they present to each
other are constantly changing. For a feature on Mars
to be visible from a given post on earth, observer and
observed must confront each other, and, furthermore,
it must be day there when it is night here. But, as
Mars takes about forty minutes longer to turn than the
Earth, such confronting occurs later and later each
night by about forty minutes, until finally it does not
occur at all while Mars is suitably above the horizon;
then the feature passes from sight to remain hidden
till the difference of the rotations brings it round into
view again. There are thus times when a given region
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_288' id='Page_288'>288</a></span>
is visible, times when it is not, and these succeed each
other in from five to six weeks, and are called presentations.
For about a fortnight at each presentation a
region is centrally enough placed to be well seen; for
the rest of the period either ill-placed or on the other
side of the planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >If a marking were always salient enough it would
appear in every drawing made of the disk during the
recurrent fortnights of its display. If it were weaker
than this, it might appear on some drawings and not on
others, dependent upon its own strength and upon the
definition at the moment, and we should have a certain
percentage of visibility for it at that presentation.
While if it changed in strength between one presentation
and the next, the percentage of its recording would
change likewise. Definition of course is always varying,
but if its value be noted at the time of each drawing
this factor may be allowed for more or less successfully.
Making such allowance, together with other
corrections to produce extrinsic equality, such as the
planet’s distance, which we need not enter upon here,
we are left with only the marking’s intrinsic visibility
to affect the percentages; that is, the percentages tell
of the changes it has successively undergone and give
us a history of its wax and wane.</p>

<p class='c008' >From drawings accurately made it is possible to add
to the accuracy of the percentage by noting in each,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
not only the presence or absence of the marking, but
the degree of strength with which it is represented.
This was done on the final investigation in the present
case, and it was interesting to note how little difference
it made in the result.</p>

<p class='c008' >The longitude of each canal was known, and the
longitude of the central meridian of each drawing was
always calculated and tabulated with the drawing, so
that it was possible to tell which drawings might have
shown the canal. Only when the position of the canal
was within a certain number of degrees of the centre
of the drawing (60°) was the drawing used in the
result, allowance being duly made for the loss upon the
phase side. Each drawing, it should be remembered,
was as nearly an instantaneous picture of the disk as
possible. It covered only a few minutes of observation,
and was made practically as if the observer had
never seen the planet before. In other words, the
man was sunk in the manner. Such mental effacement
is as vital to good observation as mental assertion is
afterward to pregnant reasoning. For a man should
be a machine in collecting his data, a mind in coördinating
them. To reverse the process, as is sometimes
done, is not conducive to science.</p>

<p class='c008' >When the successive true percentages of visibility
of a given canal had thus been found, they were plotted
vertically at points along a horizontal line corresponding
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
in distance from the origin to the number of days
after (or before) the summer solstice of the Martian
northern hemisphere. The horizontal distance thus
measured the time while the vertical height gave the
relative visibility. The points so plotted were then
joined by a smooth curve. This curve reproduced the
continuous change in visibility undergone by the canal
during the period under observation. It gave a
graphic picture of the canal’s change of state. It
seemed, therefore, proper to call it the canal’s cartouche
or sign manual.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this manner were obtained the cartouches of 109
canals. Now, as the presence or absence of any canal
in any drawing was entirely irrespective of the
presence or absence of another, each such datum
spoke only for itself, and was an entirely independent
observation. The whole investigation thus rested on
10,900 completely separate determinations, each as
unconditioned by the others as if it existed alone.</p>

<p class='c008' >As every factor outside of the canal itself which could
affect the latter’s visibility was taken account of, and
the correction due to it as nearly as possible applied
before the cartouches were deduced, the latter represent
the visibility of the canal <em>due to intrinsic change
alone</em>. In other words, they give not the apparent only
but the real history of the canal for the period concerned.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
Important disclosures result from inspection of the
cartouches. This we shall perceive by considering what
different curves mean in the case. If the canal were
an unchangeable phenomenon, for any reason whatever,
its cartouche would be a <em>straight line parallel to
the horizon</em> of the diagram. This is evident from the
fact that the visibility would then never vary. If,
on the other hand, it were waxing and waning, and the
wax or wane were uniform, the cartouche would be a
straight line <em>inclined to the horizontal</em>; rising if the
canal were increasing, falling when it decreased.
Lastly, if the rate of change itself varied, the cartouche
would be a curve concave or convex to the line denoting
the time, according as the rate of change of the
growth or decay grew greater or less.</p>

<p class='c008' >To see this the more clearly, we may set over against
the cartouche the canal character it signalizes:—</p>

</table>

<p class='c008' >If the cartouche first falls and then rises, this shows
the canal to have passed through a minimum state at
the time denoted by the point of inflection; if it rises
first and falls afterward, this betokens in the same way
a maximum. Thus the cartouches reveal to us the
complete history of the canals,—what changes they
underwent and the times at which these occurred.
The cartouche, then, is the graphic portrayal of the
canal’s behavior. It not only distinguishes at once
between the dead and the living, as we may call the
effect of intrinsic change, but it tells the exact character
of this change,—the way it varied from time to time,
the epoch at which the development was at its minimum
or its maximum for any given canal, and lastly, its
actual strength at any time, thus giving its relative
importance in the canal system. For the height of the
curve above the diagrammatic horizon marks the absolute
as well as the relative visibility and enables us to
rank the canals between themselves.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, the first point it furnishes a criterion for is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
real or illusory character of the canals. If a line be due
to illusion, whether optical or physical, it can vary only
from extrinsic cause, since it has no intrinsic existence.
If, therefore, all extrinsic cause be allowed for, the cartouche
of this ghost must needs be a <em>horizontal straight
line</em>. Even if the extrinsic factors to its production
be imperfectly accounted for, their retention could only
cause systematic variations from the straight line in all
the lines, which would themselves vary systematically,
and these factors could therefore be detected.</p>

<p class='c008' >This criterion is absolute. Unless all the cartouches
were approximately straight lines, no illusion theory
of any kind whatever could explain the facts. Even
then the lines might all be real; for unchangeable reality
would produce the same effect on the cartouches as illusion.
In the case therefore of horizontal straight line
cartouches, we should have no guarantee on that score
of reality or illusion; but, on the other hand, curves or
inclined straight lines in them would be instantly fatal
to all illusion theories.</p>

<p class='c008' >Turning now to the 109 cartouches obtained in 1903,
the first point to strike one’s notice is that all but three
of them are curves and that even these three must be
accepted with a caveat. Here, then, the cartouches dispose
once and for all of any and every illusion theory.
They show conclusively that the canals are real objects
which wax and wane from some intrinsic cause.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
The second result afforded by the cartouches is not of
a destructive, negative character,—however valuable
the destruction of bars to knowledge may be,—but of
a constructive, positive one. It does not, like the first,
follow from mere inspection, but is brought to light only
by comparison of all the cartouches. In a positive way,
therefore, its testimony is as conclusive as it was in a negative
direction. For that 10,900 separate and independent
data should result in a general law of development
through either conscious or unconscious bias, when those
data would have to be combined in so complicated a
manner for the result to emerge as is here the case, is
impossible. Chance could not do it and consciousness
would require a coördinate memory, to which Murphy’s
nine games of chess at once would be child’s play.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of the 109 canals examined 106 showed by their cartouches
that they had been during the whole or a part
of the period in a state of change. But the change
was not the same for all. In some the minimum came
early; in others, late. Some decreased to nothing and
stayed there; others increased from zero and were
increasing still at the time observations closed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Latitude proved the means of bringing comparative
order out of the chaos. When the canals were ranged
according to their latitude on the planet, a law in their
development came to light. To understand it, the
circumstances under which the canals were presented
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
must be considered as regards the then season of
the planet’s year. In 1903 the planet passed on
February 28 through the point of its orbit where the
summer solstice of the northern hemisphere occurs.
One hundred and twenty-six days later took place the
first snowfall in the arctic and subarctic regions, an
event that denoted the beginning of the new polar cap;
from which date the snow there gradually increased.
Its autumnal equinox the planet did not reach till
August 29. Now, the canals were observed from thirty-six
days before the summer solstice of the northern
hemisphere to one hundred and forty-seven days after
that event. We may tabulate the dates as follows:—</p>

The 109 canals included all the more conspicuous
canals on the planet at that opposition, all those
that lent themselves by the sufficient frequency
with which they were seen to a statistical result.
They lay spread all the way between the edge of
the polar cap in latitude 87° north to the extreme
limit south, at which the then tilt of the north pole
toward the earth permitted of canal recognition.
This southern limit was in about latitude 35° south.
Farther south than this vision became too oblique,
amounting as it did, with an adverse tilt of twenty-five
degrees to start with, to something over sixty
degrees, for detection of such fine markings to be
possible. Between the two limits thus imposed, by
the perpetual snow on the one side and the observational
tilt on the other, the 109 canals were
distributed by zones as follows:—</p>

As the latitude of a canal in the investigation was
taken as that of its mid-point, such being the mean
value of its successive parts, the latitudes about which
information was obtained lay within the limits given
above, the most northern canal, the Jaxartes N having
for its mid-latitude 78° north, and the most southern,
the Nectar, that of 27° south.</p>

<p class='c008' >The zones comprised each a belt of territory about
thirteen degrees wide, the first being less solely because
in part occupied by the permanent polar cap.</p>

<p class='c008' >The curves of all the canals in a given zone have been
combined into a mean curve or cartouche for that
zone; and then the cartouches for the several zones
have been represented and ranged according to latitude
on the accompanying plate. Consideration of
these mean canal cartouches is very instructive. In
the first place not one of them is a straight line, either
horizontal or inclined. All are curves and, with the
exception of the top one, all show a minimum or lowest
point during the period under observation. From this
point they rise with the time, or to the right on the
plate. A black star marks this minimum, and is found
farther and farther to the right as one goes down the
plate; that is, as one travels from the neighborhood of
the arctic regions down to the equator and then over
into the planet’s southern hemisphere. Drawing now
a line approximately through the stars and remembering
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
that the minimum means the date at which the canal
started to develop, we see that the canal development
began at the border of the north polar cap and thence
continued down the disk over the planet’s surface, as
far as observation permitted the surface to be seen,
which was some thirty-five degrees into the other hemisphere.
This is the first broad fact disclosed by the
cartouches.</p>

<div id='i_b_298' class='imgcenter'>
<div class='div-300'>
<a href='images/i_b_298-l.jpg'><img src='images/i_b_298.jpg' alt='' class='img-300' /></a>
<p class='ce-caption'><i>MEAN CANAL CARTOUCHES</i></p>
<p class='re-caption'>P.L.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >Furthermore, the development took place at an
approximately uniform rate. This is shown by the
fact that the line passing through the black stars is
approximately straight; for such straightness means
that progression down the disk as measured by the
latitude bore throughout the same ratio to the time
elapsed.</p>

<p class='c008' >Looking at them again we notice that the three topmost
cartouches, those of the north polar, arctic, and
sub-arctic canals respectively, dip at the right before
the end of the observations, while the other seven were
still rising when those observations were brought to a
close. A reason for this, or at least a significant coincidence,
is to be found in the dotted line pendent from
the top of the table and labelled “First Frosts.” This
dotted line denotes the date at which the first extensive
frost occurred in the polar regions; for even before
this time patches of white had appeared north of the
Mare Acidalium, denoting the on-coming of the cold.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
The frost did not last but came and went and came
again just as it does on earth, growing more insistent
and long-lived at each fresh fall. Its sphere of operation
was confined to the three zones in question.
Even these zones it by no means covered, merely
blotching them in places with fungi-like patches of frost.
Beyond them south it never extended during the period
of the observations; indeed, it hardly entered the sub-arctic
zone at all at this very beginning of the polar
winter. For it was only August 20 then. The coincidence
of the isotherm as betrayed by the deposition
of frost with the dividing line between the canal-development
curves that dip down at this season and
those that still continue to rise is suggestive.</p>

<p class='c008' >It becomes all the more so when the three cartouches
are considered seriatim. The most polewards, the
north polar one, had sunk to zero sometime before the
first extensive frost occurred; the second, the arctic,
did so later than its northern neighbor, probably just
before the epoch in question; while the third, practically
outside the zone of deposition, was behind both
the others in its descent. Inspection of the drawings
upon which the cartouches are based confirms an inference
deduced from this: that it was cold that killed,
not frost that covered, them, which was responsible
for their obliteration. The drawings show that the
canals ceased to be seen before the white patches were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
evident. Now this would be the exact behavior of
vegetation. It would be killed, turned brown by
freezing, and so rendered invisible to us against its
ochre desert background, before the cold had grown
intense enough to cover that ground with a solid white
carpet of frost. At the opposition of 1905, however,
the extreme northern canals were visible after the snow
had covered all the country about them, being evident
as lines threading the new cap.</p>

<p class='c008' >These three cartouches furthermore show each a
maximum, and what is significant the maximum occurs
later in time for each, according as the zone lies remote
from the pole. A red star marks this maximum and
shows that the time of greatest development for the
three zones was respectively:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>41 days after the summer solstice for the North Polar.</div>
      <div class='line'>61 days after the summer solstice for the Arctic.</div>
      <div class='line'>95 days after the summer solstice for the Sub-Arctic.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >We now pass to the other curves, those that were
unaffected by cold. Though in these the minima themselves
show the law of latitudinal progression, the wavelike
character of the advance is even better disclosed
by the curves. As the eye follows them down the
page, the advance of the wave to the right is plainly
apparent. The slope of the wave is much the same for
all, implying that a like force was at work successively
down the latitudes.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_302' id='Page_302'>302</a></span>
It will be noticed next that in all the mean cartouches
the gradient is greater after the minimum
than before it. The curves fall gently to their lowest
points and rise more steeply from them. Such profile
indicates that the effects of a previous force were slowly
dying out down to the minimum and that then an impulse
started in to act afresh. This explains the attitude
of the canals that died out. In them the effect
of the old force shows as in the others, but no impulse
came in their case to resuscitation.</p>

<p class='c008' >It seems possible to trace this force to an origin at
the south. For beginning with the north sub-tropic
zone the gradient on the left shows less and less steep
southward to the south sub-tropic zone. Such a
dying-down swell is what should be looked for in an
impulse which had travelled from the south northward,
since the wave would affect the more northern zones
last, and less of a calm period would intervene between
the two impulses from opposite poles.</p>

<p class='c008' >The cartouches, then, state that the canals began to
develop after the greatest melting of the polar cap
had occurred; that this development proceeded down
the latitudes to the equator, and then not stopping
there advanced up the latitudes of the other hemisphere.
In the next place they show that in the
arctic region the development was arrested and devolution
or decay set in as it began to get cold there,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
the most northern canals being affected first. Finally,
that a similar wave of evolution had occurred from
the opposite pole some time before and had then
passed away. And this evidence of the cartouches
is direct, and independent of any theory.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_8 c015'     >As an interesting instance of the law of development
we may take the career of the Brontes
during this same Martian year; the Brontes witnessing
individually to the same evolutionary process that
the canals collectively exhibit.</p>

<p class='c008' >The Brontes is one of the most imposing canals upon
the planet. It is not so much its length which renders
it a striking object, though this length is enough to
entitle it to consideration, being no less than 2440 miles.
Its direction is what singles it out to notice, for it runs
almost north and south. For this reason it swings into
a position to hold the centre of the stage for a time with
the precision of a meridian, as the planet’s rotation
turns its longitude into view. The points which it
connects help also to add to its distinction. For the
Sinus Titanum at its southern end and the Propontis
at its northern are both among the conspicuous points
of the disk. The latter is but twelve degrees farther
east than the former, while it is sixty-six degrees farther
north. This long distance,—from nearly the line of the
tropics in the southern hemisphere to mid-temperate
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
regions of the northern,—the canal runs in an
absolutely straight course.</p>

<p class='c008' >Its north and south character commends it for any
investigation of canal development, since it runs in the
general direction that development takes. Its great
latitudinal stretch further fits it for a recorder of
changes sweeping down the disk; so that both in direction
and length it stands well circumstanced for a
measure of latitudinal variations. The fact that it is
usually a fairly conspicuous canal does not detract from
its virtue in this respect. It was first recognized at
Flagstaff in 1894. But once realized, so to speak, it was
possible to identify it with a canal seen by Schiaparelli
and supposed by him to be the Titan; indeed, it played
hide and seek with that canal throughout his drawings.
In 1894 both it and the Titan were so well seen that its
separate existence was unmistakable, causing it to be
both recognized and named. It is, like the Titan, one
of the sheaf of canals descending the disk from the
Sinus Titanum, and lies just to the east of the Titan in
the bunch. In 1896 it was also prominent; and at
both these oppositions most so from its southern end,
its northern one being more or less indefinite, especially
in 1894.</p>

<p class='c008' >In 1901 it was not the same. Instead of being the
conspicuous canal it had been in earlier years, it was
now so faint as with difficulty to be made out. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
remained so to the close of observations. It was now
under suspicion. Its behavior in 1896-1897 had led
to the supposition that not only were seasonal changes
taking place in it, but that those changes were such as
to point to a law in the case with which its conduct in
1901 fayed in. The suspicion did not, however, become
a certainty till the opposition of 1903. The length
of time during which the disk was then kept under scrutiny
resulted in the method of its metamorphosis being
discovered.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008' >At the very start of observations its longitude chanced
to be nearly central and it was made out; but so far off
was the planet that only its
northern part could be detected,
because, as afterward
appeared, this part
was the stronger, the canal
being decidedly inconspicuous,
whereas other canals,
the northern and even the
Pallene and the Dis, were
strongly marked. At the
next presentation the planet was nearer, and details
previously hidden for the distance now came out.
Among them was the Brontes, which, showing better
than in January, could be traced all the way to the
Sinus Titanum. A drawing (I) made on February 25
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
and reproduced in the text shows its appearance at
the time. Its emergence under neared conditions
only served to accentuate
its relative inconspicuousness,
for it showed now
notably inferior to the
northern canals, and this
not only in the matter of
general visibility, but in
the character it displayed.
It was a line of hazy definition,
contrasting thus
with the sharp dark forms of its northern neighbors.</p>

<p class='c008' >As the planet steadily approached the earth, and the
canals to the north became
better and better seen, the
Brontes instead of sharing
in the general improvement
did exactly the opposite.
It grew less visible
when it should have grown
more so, if distance had
been the cause of its appearance.
It was now
only to be seen at the north, even when it was seen
at all; a state of things exemplified in Drawings II
and III.</p>

<p class='c008' >As the planet now went away and detail should have
dimmed, the Brontes proceeded to do the opposite. One
had almost said it was actuated by a spirit of contrariety.
For now when it
had reason to grow faint
it grew in conspicuousness;
just as, before, when
it should have become evident,
it had declined. Distinctly
farther off and
smaller as the planet was
at the next presentation,
the Brontes had clearly
developed both in tone and in the amount of it visible.
This was in May (Drawings IV and V). In June bad
seeing prevented good observations,
but in July,
Drawing VI, when the region
again came round, the
Brontes, in spite of the then
greatly increased distance,
asserted itself so strongly
that even in not very good
seeing its presence could
not be passed by.</p>

<p class='c008' >This contrariety of behavior had about it one very
telling feature. That the canal waxed or waned in exact
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
opposition to distance and even toward the last to seeing
too, showed conclusively that neither distance nor
definition could in any way be held responsible for its
metamorphoses. A very fortunate circumstance, this of
the observations, for it directly eliminated size of disk,
phase, and seeing, for which correction are none too easy
to make, and which in the minds of the sceptical could
always remain as unexplained
possibilities of error.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >The mean-canal cartouches
show synthetically,
and all the more conclusively
for being composite,
the laws of the flux of the
canals. Something more of
vividness, however, is imparted
by the actual look of
one of the constituents during the process. It is the
difference between seeing a composite picture made
from a given group of men and the gazing on the actual
features of any one of them. So much is gained by the
drawings across the page of the Brontes at different
stages of its evolution during the period here concerned.
But in another way, too, the one canal may be made to
yield a more lifelike representation of the process than
a number taken together are capable of affording. In
the mean-canal cartouches each canal is treated as an
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
entity; but it is possible to consider a canal by parts,
and by so doing to see it in action, as it were. It
occurred to me to treat the Brontes in this way. For
this purpose I divided the canal into sections, five of
them in all, between the point where it left the Propontis,
at a spot called the Propropontis, to where it
ended in the Sinus Titanum. The first, the most
northern, extended as far as Semnon Lucus, the southernmost
outpost of the Propontis congeries of spots.
The second continued on from these to Eleon, the
junction where the Erebus crossed. The third thence
to Utopia, where the canal met the Orcus; the fourth
to an arbitrary point in latitude 8° south, and the fifth
and last to the Sinus Titanum. The lengths of these
sections were respectively: 12°, 16°, 15°, 12°, and 13°.
Each of the sections was then treated as if it were a
separate canal and its cartouche found. To the cartouches’
determination there were available drawings:</p>

north polar one.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Connected with the conduct of the canals is a
phenomenon, examples of which were early noted
in a general way by Schiaparelli and later, but of
which the full import and exhibition only came to light
during the opposition of 1903 by a very striking metamorphosis:
what may be called the hibernation of a
canal for a longer or shorter term of years. What
observation discloses is certainly curious. For several
successive oppositions a canal will be seen in a definite
locality, as regular in seasonal recurrence as it is permanent
in place, a well-recognized feature of the disk.
Then to one’s surprise, with the next return of the
planet, it will fail to appear, and will proceed to remain
obliterate without assignable cause for many Martian
years, until as unexpectedly it will be found what and
where it was before. Neither to deposition of hoar-frost,
such as frequently whitens whole regions of Mars,
nor to other circumstances can be attributed its disappearance.
Without apparent reason it simply ceases
to be and then as simply comes back again.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
Such bopeep behavior is quite beyond and apart
from the seasonal change in visibility, to which all the
canals are by their nature subject. For being creatures
of the semi-annual unlocking of the water congealed
about the polar caps, they quicken into growth and
visibility, each in its season, and as regularly die out
again. Different, however, is the phenomenon to
which I now refer. In it not a seasonal but a secular
change is concerned. The season proper to the canal’s
increase will recur in due course, and the canals round
about it will start to life, yet the canal remains unquickened.
Nothing responds where in years the response
was immediate and invariable. The canal lies dormant
spite of seasonal solicitation to stir.</p>

<p class='c008' >Such curious hibernation was early hinted to the
keenness of Schiaparelli, and most incomprehensible as
well as difficult of verification at that stage the phenomenon
was. That the absence was a fact, however,
he assured himself, although he was not able to prove
an alibi. But at the last opposition an event of the
sort occurred which, from the length of time the planet
was kept under observation, combined with continued
suitableness of the seeing, unmasked the process. In
the light of what then happened, taken in connection
with the side-lights thrown upon it by the canal’s past
and by the knowledge we have meanwhile gained of the
planet’s physical condition, the riddle of the phenomenon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_315' id='Page_315'>315</a></span>
may in part at least be read, and most interesting
and instructive the reading proves to be.</p>

<p class='c008' >Among the initial canals detected by Schiaparelli,
in 1877, was a tricrural set of lines recalling the heraldic
design of three flexed legs joined equiangularly above
the knees. It lay to the east of the Syrtis Major, and
he called its three members the Thoth, the Triton, and
the Nepenthes. Starting from the head of his gulf
of Alcyonius, at a point now known to be occupied by
the oasis called Aquae Calidae, the Thoth started
south inclining westward as it went, till in longitude
267° and latitude 15° north, it met the Triton, which
had come from the Syrtis Minor with similar westward
inclination. To the same point in the same manner
came the Nepenthes. Part way along the course of the
latter was to be seen a small dark spot, the Lucus
Moeris, which he estimated at four degrees in diameter.
Some of the markings were easier than others, the
easiest of all being the Lucus Tritonis, a largish dark
spot at the common intersection of all three canals;
but that none of the markings were remarkably difficult
is sufficiently shown by their detection at this early
stage of Schiaparelli’s observations. It is worth noting
also that he discovered the southern ones first; the
Thoth not being seen till March, 1878. As his then
recognition of these canals witnesses, they must have
been among the most evident on the disk. And the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>316</a></span>
point is emphasized by the fact that he failed at this
opposition to detect the Phison and the Euphrates
as separate markings.</p>

<p class='c008' >Much the same the three canals appeared to him at
the next opposition of 1879, the Thoth being seen at its
several presentations from October 5, 1879, to January
11, 1880.</p>

<p class='c008' >At the next opposition a noteworthy alteration
occurred, the full significance of which escaped recognition.
Schiaparelli saw, at the place where the Thoth
had been, two lines which he took for a gemination of
that canal, one of which followed the course of the old
Thoth, while the other went straight from the Sinus
Alcyonius to the Little Syrtis, or, more precisely, to the
junction of the Triton and the Lethes. It was not the
Thoth, however, but something unsuspected, of more
importance.</p>

<p class='c008' >In 1884 the Thoth showed really double, the western
line being much the stronger, “una delle piu grosse
linee que si vedessero sul disco.” That neither branch
went farther than the meeting-place with the Nepenthes
argues that it was indeed the Thoth that was seen.
Schiaparelli himself had no doubt on the subject, although
he drew the double canal he saw due north and
south from the tip of the Sinus Alcyonius to the junction,
but nevertheless along the 263° meridian.</p>

<p class='c008' >In 1886 and 1888 the system was in all essentials,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_317' id='Page_317'>317</a></span>
what it had been in 1877 and 1879, except that the
Thoth and Nepenthes were double and were more
minutely seen.</p>

<p class='c008' >Here, then, was a system of canals and spots which
for six Martian years had been a persistent and substantially
invariable feature of the Martian surface.
Any changes in it had been of a secondary order of importance,
while its general visibility was of the first.
It is possible, then, to judge of my perplexity when in
beginning my observations in 1894 no sign of the system
could I detect. Of neither the Thoth, the Triton, the
Nepenthes, nor the Lucus Moeris was there trace. And
yet, from the other canals visible, it was evident that
the disk was quite as well seen as it had been by Schiaparelli.
Not only were practically all his canals there,
but many much smaller ones were to be made out.
And the same was true of the spots, a host of such not
figured by him appearing here and there over the
planet’s surface.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nor was this all. Instead of the Thoth, another canal
showed straight down the disk from the Syrtis Minor
to the Aquae Calidae. This canal was as unmistakable
as the Thoth had been before to Schiaparelli. It was
among the first to be detected, and continued no less
conspicuous to the end, the dates at which it was seen
being July 10, August 14, and October 21. I called it
the Amenthes, identifying it with the canal so named
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_318' id='Page_318'>318</a></span>
in Schiaparelli’s chart published in <cite>Himmel und
Erde</cite>, of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ensemble</span></i> of his observations from 1877 to
1888. But in his Memoirs he never called it so, seeing
it, indeed, only in 1881-1882, and deeming it then the
Thoth. Nevertheless, in 1894, it was the conspicuous
canal of the region, and, what is more, had come, as
it proved, to stay.</p>

<p class='c008' >The invisibility of the Thoth continued for me the
same during the succeeding oppositions of 1896-1897
and 1901. At the former opposition I drew it in 1896
on July 28, August 26, September 2, October 5-9,
seeing it single; and in 1897 on January 12-19, February
21, and March 1. It was single but with suspicions
of doubling in January, and was indubitably double in
February. As for the Thoth, I had come to consider
it and the Amenthes one, attributing their diversity
of depiction to errors in drawing. For while the Thoth
remained obstinately invisible, the Amenthes presented
itself as substitute so insistently as to make one of the
most obvious canals upon the disk.</p>

<p class='c008' >One exception only was there to this state of things.
On June 16, 1901, my notes contain this adumbration
of a something else: “Amenthes sometimes appeared
with a turn to it two-thirds way up; two canals concave
to the Syrtis Major.”</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Amenthes alone in February.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >So matters opened at the opposition of 1903. With
the advent of the planet and the presentation in due
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_319' id='Page_319'>319</a></span>
course of Libya in February, the Amenthes duly appeared,
much as it had showed at the opposition before,
only less salient. It was a
confused and seemingly narrower
double. Suspected
on the 16th of that month,
it was definitely seen from
the 18th to the 23d. Of
the Thoth no mention is
made either in the notes or
in the drawings. When the
region came round again, in
March, the Amenthes was still there, showing more
feebly, however, than it had in February, in spite of
better seeing and the fact
that the planet had considerably
neared. Clearly the
canal was fading out; a fact
further witnessed to by the
following note made on
March 25: “Throughout
this opposition thus far the
dark triangle tipped by
Aquae Calidae has been
sharply divided in intensity from the Amenthes, which
is very narrow and exceedingly faint.” Still was
there no trace of the Thoth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_320' id='Page_320'>320</a></span>
With the April presentation entered a new order of
things. When the region first became visible, on the
16th, the Amenthes could still be seen and alone;
but on the 19th, as the relative falling back of the Martian
longitudes swung the
region nearer the centre of
the disk, the Thoth appeared
alongside of it. On the
20th the Thoth showed
alone. Unmistakable it was
and just as Schiaparelli had
drawn it, accompanied by
the Triton and the curved
Nepenthes. The thing was
a revelation. What before I
had seen only in the spirit of another’s drawings stood
there patent to me in the body of my own; while the
Amenthes, to which I had so long been accustomed,
had vanished into thin air. Only a trace of it was
now and then to be made out. So startlingly strange
was the metamorphosis that I could not at first trust
my eyes, and questioned the broken line, which had
replaced the straight, for some ocular deception. But
nothing I could do would rectify it. The Amenthes
was gone and the Thoth stood in its stead.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Appearance of Thoth with Triton

Amenthes vanished. April 20.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >At the next presentation, May 26 to June 8, the
phenomena were repeated, and with increasing clarity.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_321' id='Page_321'>321</a></span>
And then of a sudden, on May 29, I saw the long-given-up
Lucus Moeris. There it was indubitably.
And its definiteness was the most astonishing part of
the affair. It was no question of difficult detection.
Indeed, I had not been on the lookout for it, having
searched the region too often
fruitlessly before to have
left incentive to search again.
And so, when I was not
searching, the thing of its
own accord stepped forth
to sight. It was a small
round dot, like to any other
oasis, and showed, as it were,
a black pearl pendent by
the Nepenthes from the Syrtis’s ear. For the Libyan
bay made a dark projection of the sort high up on the
Syrtis’s eastern side, from which the Nepenthes, precisely
as Schiaparelli had drawn it, curved down to the
point where the Thoth and Triton met. All three
canals were geminated, the gemination being about
three degrees wide.</p>

<p class='ce-caption'>Advent of the Lucus Moeris.
May 29.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >And now occurred the last act in the drama. In
July the Amenthes reappeared, showing alongside of
the Thoth-Nepenthes, and thus removing any possible
doubt as to their separate identity. It had, indeed,
become the stronger of the two, having gained in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_322' id='Page_322'>322</a></span>
strength in the interval between June and July and
the Thoth-Nepenthes having lost. The lines were in
process of relapsing into the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo ante</span></i>. Had
these three presentations not been watched, the brief
apparition of the Thoth-Nepenthes had been missed
and with it the revealing of
its curious character, and
of certain deductions thereupon.</p>

<div class='illus-300'>
 <img src='images/i_b_322.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='ce-caption'>Amenthes with Thoth-Nepenthes.
July.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >First among these is a
truth of which I have long
been convinced; to wit, that
when a seeming discordance
arises between the portrayals
of a canal, it is commonly
not a case of mistake nor of change, but one of separate
identity. The canal has not shifted its place, nor has
an error been committed; the fact is that one canal
has been observed at one time, another at another.</p>

<p class='c008' >So it was here, and thus were the old and the new
observations reconciled. There had been no mistake
in either. Two separate canals accounted for the discrepancy,
and only an unfounded distrust of the accuracy
possible in such observations was to blame for
any failure to recognize the fact.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, scrutiny of the notes upon the appearance of the
two canals, together with their labeling by the seasonal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_323' id='Page_323'>323</a></span>
longitudes of the planet at the dates they were made,
discloses a curious relation between the two. The
seasonal longitudes are important, as they date the
phenomena according to the Martian calendar. Ordered
thus, the successive aspects reveal first a seasonal
change in each canal and then over and above this a
secular one. And this secular change was such as to
cause the two canals to alternate in visibility. When
the one was present the other was not, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versa</span></i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008' >We shall see this more clearly and at the same time
bring out a curious relation between the two systems,
the broken bow of the Thoth-Nepenthes-Triton and the
straight arrow of the Amenthes, while looking at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_324' id='Page_324'>324</a></span>
cartouches of the Thoth, the Amenthes, and a combination
of both given in the plate on previous page.</p>

<p class='c008' >The antithetical character of the two canals is apparent.
But what is further interesting, the combination
cartouche of both bears a singular resemblance to that
of the mean canal of the north tropic zone, the zone
to which both canals belong. Here, then, is a combination
which is perfectly regular while each of its constituents
is anomalous.</p>

<p class='c008' >And now we come to something as important: at
the opposition of 1905 the curious alternation metamorphosis
was enacted anew. The Amenthes appeared,
disappeared to be replaced by the Thoth, and then reappeared
again beside the other. This corroboration
of behavior showed the previous observations to have
been due to no mistake, and only served to deepen the
interest in this last and more singular phase of canal
conduct.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_9 c015'     >Last in time but not least in importance of the
details of canal development to be detected is one
that connects these strange features directly with the
melting of the polar caps. The cartouches showed
that such connection was to be inferred; the facts now
to be recorded depict it by an identity of place between
certain phenomena of the two subjects following one
another in order of time.</p>

<p class='c008' >On January 8, 1897, while scanning the planet, I
was suddenly ware of a rift in the north polar cap. It
ran a little to the west of south from where it started
in at the cap’s edge and went clean through to the limb,
the pole being then slightly tilted away from us. At the
time it seemed to be the first rift ever seen in that
cap; but on opening a little later Schiaparelli’s <cite>Memoria
Quarta</cite>, which had just arrived, the first thing my eye
fell on was a drawing of a rift in the north polar cap
observed by him when the planet had held the like
attitude toward the Earth thirteen years before. Reference
to its longitude showed it to be the identical
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_326' id='Page_326'>326</a></span>
rift, seen again after all these years and the only one
so far seen in the northern cap.</p>

<p class='c008' >At the next opposition more rifts were detected, one
in especial on December 27, running from Arethusa
Lucus, then upon the edge of the cap, athwart the
snow in a northwesterly direction.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the forepart of the opposition of 1901, which in its
Martian season corresponded to that in 1897, when the
rift had been observed, many rifts were detected in the
cap, and among them one traversing the cap north-northeasterly
in longitude 136°.</p>

<p class='c008' >So far the season when the cap had been observed
was that when the rifts were in process of forming.
The ground they and the snow-cap covered had not yet
at any opposition been uncovered.</p>

<p class='c008' >It was only when my observations began in the
latter half of the opposition of 1901 that, the season on
Mars having so far advanced, all snow in those latitudes
had melted. Then appeared, however, the canal
Hippalus, an arctic canal of some importance, lying
on that part of the planet previously occupied by the
polar cap. When later studying the observations
on the rifts I remembered this canal, and turning
to the drawing made some months before to compare
the two critically, discovered that the canal occupied
the precise position held earlier by the rift. One had
said the rift had never vanished, but that the white
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_327' id='Page_327'>327</a></span>
surrounding it had simply turned to ochre. Here,
then, was a striking coincidence of place, too exact to
be the result of chance.</p>

<p class='c008' >Impressed by the identity, I examined all the other
rifts seen early in 1901, comparing them with the arctic
canals seen later, to the finding of no less than five cases
of the same coinciding positions.</p>

<p class='c008' >The importance of the identification here made of an
arctic canal with a previous rift in the polar cap has
led me to make a list of the canals thus identified at
this opposition.</p>

<p class='c008' >If it be asked why these canals do not appear recorded
at the March presentation as either the one phenomenon
or the other, the answer is twofold. First, because they
showed as shadings lost amidst a shaded mass; and,
secondly, the observations at several oppositions indicate
a great amount of haze over the region at that
season of the Martian year.</p>

<p class='c008' >We may now go back to the very first rift, that of
1897. The Martian season grew later with each succeeding
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_328' id='Page_328'>328</a></span>
opposition, and it so chanced, abetted by this
fact, that the delaying snow was never seen covering
that part of the planet again and so, of course, not
the rift. The Martian summer in those high latitudes
came on, and with it brought the great arctic
canal, the Jaxartes, into conspicuousness. The canal
in consequence had been observed for some time
before it proclaimed itself the apotheosis of a rift
and that of the first and most important rift of all.
Comparison of position, however, entirely confirmed
the conjecture and added another and the most
striking of all to the list.</p>

<p class='c008' >These six canals, on the whole the largest which run
into the northern cap, have thus a dual character.
Starting originally as rifts, they later come out unmistakably
as canals. So that we may say in general
that the two phenomena are different seasonal states
of the same thing. This instantly explains the rifts,
the origin of which we found of so difficult, not to say
impossible, interpretation before in these pages, and
incidentally it confirms what we deduced on other
grounds as the character of the canals; to wit, strips
of vegetation. For if the cap covered desert and
fertility alike, it is precisely over the latter that it
would first melt.</p>

<p class='c008' >Vegetation has the property of melting snow. The
metabolism of the plant, like that of the animal, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_329' id='Page_329'>329</a></span>
in a less degree, generates caloric. A living animal is
warm, even the so-called cold-blooded ones, in some
sort, and a growing plant is too. The chemic processes
concerned give off heat, though in such small quantities
that we are often not aware of it. While the plant lies
dormant it stays cold, but the moment its sap begins
to run under the rays of the spring sun it rises in
temperature above its winter surroundings. All it
needs to this awakening is sun and water, and both it
gets in its place in the polar cap after the passing of the
vernal equinox. The time, therefore, is suitable, for
it is not till after that equinox is passed that any of the
above phenomena occur. In consequence the snow
about it melts and the plants themselves show as
dark rifts splitting the cap.</p>

<p class='c008' >This quite unexpected identity of two seemingly
diverse phenomena, and the unsolicited support its
only explanation lends to the general theory, is an
instance of what is constantly occurring as observation
of the planet is pushed farther and farther. Facts
every little while arise which prove to fit into place in
the scheme when neither the facts nor their fitness
could have been foreseen.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Subject to change also are the oases; and in the
same manner apparently as the canals. They
grow less evident at a like season of the Martian year.
They do this seemingly by decreasing in size. Whereas
in the full expanse of their maturity they show as
round spots of appreciable diameter, as the season
wanes they contract to the smallest discernible of dots.
All but the kernel, as it were, fades out, and even this
may disappear from sight. The Phœnix Lake in
its summer time is a very dark circular spot, small
indeed yet of definite extension; in its winter it shrinks
to a pin point, and is often not visible at all. Sometimes
the husk apparently persists, a ghostlike reminiscence
of what it was, with the kernel showing dark-pointed
in its centre. Thus the Lucus Lunae appeared
at the opposition of 1905. A faint wash betokened the
presence of the Lucus, through which now and again
a black pin-point pierced.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this visible decrease of size we get a revelation as
to what takes place impossible in the case of the canals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_331' id='Page_331'>331</a></span>
the tenuous character of which precludes more than
inference as to the process.</p>

<p class='c008' >Like the canals, latitude, together with the suitable
season of the planet’s year, are the determining factors
in their development. In what corresponded to our
July of the northern hemisphere the oases in the
sub-arctic and north temperate zones were conspicuous;
black spots that showed in profusion along the
parallels of 40°, 50°, and 60° north. At the same
time the equatorial ones, those along the Eumenides-Orcus,
which had been most evident in 1894, hardly
came out. It had been their time then as it was that
of the others now. The law of development is not so
simple as on the earth, depending, like that of the
canals, not only upon the return of the sun, but upon
the advent of the water let loose from about the
polar caps. Thus the equatorial oases are subject to
two seasonal quickenings, one from the north, the
other from the south.</p>

<p class='c008' >In regard to their method of evolution or devolution
a most curious observation happened to me in 1903.
Usually the oases are of solid tone throughout; equally
sombre from centre to circumference. But in this
case such uniform complexion found exception. On
March 1, 1903, the Ascraeus Lucus came out strangely
differentiated, a dark rim inclosing a less dark kernel.
The sight was odd enough to command comment in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_332' id='Page_332'>332</a></span>
shape of a sketch which accompanied the note, and the
further remark that other spots had similarly that year
affected the like look. That the effect was optical did
not seem to me the case. Other spots at other times
showed nothing of the sort. If it was due to objective
cause it gathers circumstance from what was then the
Martian time of year. For the season was such that
the spot should then have been in process of waning;
and the effect would indicate that in so doing the tone
of the centre went first, that of the circumference fading
last. This would be in accordance with a growth
proceeding outward and a decay that followed in its
steps.</p>

<p class='c008' >When to this we add the look of the oases at the
antithetic season,—often a faint shading only, with or
without a darker pin-point at its core,—we are led
to the belief that the area of the oasis is unchangeable
and that its growth means a deepening of tint.</p>

<p class='c008' >So far, then, as it is possible to particularize them,
the oases develop from a small nucleus, perhaps twenty
miles in diameter, perhaps less, and from this spread
radially till they attain a width of seventy-five or one
hundred miles. If the oasis be associated with a double
canal, this maximum width exactly fits the space between
the twin lines. Even when no double enters
the oasis, the size is about the same. This size attained,
they hold it for some months. Then they proceed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_333' id='Page_333'>333</a></span>
fade out to their initial nucleus, and after a sufficient
rest the process starts over again.</p>

<p class='c008' >With the carets something of the same sort seems to
take place—if we may consider as betokening a general
law the fact that in 1894 the carets at the mouths
of the Phison and Euphrates developed before their
affiliated canals. But about them much less is yet
known, and we must be content to say that the observations
of 1905 made at the opposite season of the
canal’s year seem to bear this out.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_7 c015'     >As rational science does not rest content with raw
results, it now becomes obligatory, by marshaling
the facts to suitable discussion, to seek to find
out what they mean. Now, so soon as we scan these
phenomena for some self-interpretation, we perceive
one characteristic of the lines which at once appears
to direct us to their nature and justifies itself as a signpost
with increasing certainty as we read on. This
trait is the very simple yet most significant one of
showing intrinsic change: the lines alter in visibility
with time. This primary proclivity we do not even need
the cartouches to establish. That the lines change is
palpable to any one who will watch them long enough.
Schiaparelli was struck by the fact early in his study of
the planet, and it forces itself on the notice of any careful
observer who compares his own observations with
one another at intervals. But though the cartouches are
not needed to a first revelation of mutability, they serve
to certify and precise it to much further information on
the subject. For, that these changes are not extrinsic,
that is, are not caused by varying definition, distance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_338' id='Page_338'>338</a></span>
or illumination, they make patent even to those who
have never seen the things themselves by disclosing
respective differences of behavior in lines similarly
circumstanced optically. The change is therefore
intrinsic, and the question arises to what can such intrinsic
change be due.</p>

<p class='c008' >In searching for cause, attention is at once attracted
by another series of transmutations that manifests
itself upon the disk, in the orderly melting of the polar
caps. For the existence of the two sets of metamorphoses
suggests the possibility of a connection between
them. The inference is strengthened when we note
that not only are both periodic, but that furthermore
the period of the two is the same. Each polar cap
runs through its gamut of change in a Martian year;
the canals also complete their cycle of growth and decay
in a Martian twelvemonth. The only difference between
the two is that each polar cap has but one maximum
and one minimum in the course of this time,
while most of the canals have two of each, though the
maxima are not alike nor the minima either.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not only is the period of the two series of changes the
same, but the one follows the other. For the development
of the canals does not begin till the melting of the
polar cap is well under way. Now, as the polar cap
disintegrates it gives rise, as we have seen, to a dark belt
of blue-green which fringes its outer edge and retreats
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_339' id='Page_339'>339</a></span>
with it as it shrinks. This tells, directly or indirectly,
of a product let loose. After this belt has been formed
the canals nearest to it proceed to darken, then those a
little farther off follow suit, and so the wave of visibility
rolls in regular routine down the disk. Here, then, at
the outset we have a chronic connection between the
two phenomena, the disintegration of the cap and the
integration of the canals.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of water we saw that the caps were undoubtedly
composed, and to water, then, let loose by the melting
of the cap, we may inferably ascribe the thaumaturgy
in the development of the canals. But it is not necessary
to suppose that this is done directly. That the
increased visibility of the canals can be due to a bodily
transference of water seems doubtful, if for no other
reason than the delay in the action. Considerable
time intervenes between the disappearance of the
cap and the appearance of the canals, except in the
case of such as have been covered by it. Transformation
consequent upon transference, however, would
account for hesitancy. A quickening to vegetal
growth would produce the counterpart of what we
see. If, set free from the winter locking up, the water
accumulated in the cap then percolated equatorward,
starting vegetation in its course, this would cause
the increased visibility of the canals and at the same
time explain the seeming delay, by allowing for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_340' id='Page_340'>340</a></span>
time necessary for this vegetation to sprout. This
is certainly the most satisfactory explanation of the
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008' >Thus started, the vegetal quickening would pass
down the planet’s surface and give rise to what we mark
as seasonal change. But, though in one sense of seasonal
character, a little consideration will show that
it would be quite unlike the seasonal change which we
know on earth.</p>

<p class='c008' >Could we see our earth from some standpoint in
space, we should mark, with the advent of spring, a
wave of verdure sweep over its face. If freedom from
cloud permitted of an unimpeded view, this flush of
waking from winter’s sleep would be quite evident and
could be seen to spread. Starting from the equator so
soon as the sun turned north, it, too, would travel northward,
and, distancing the sun, arrive by midsummer
well into the arctic zone. Here, then, we should note,
much as we note it on Mars, a tint of blue-green superpose
itself successively upon the ochre ground; but
the mundane and the Martian vegetal awakening
would differ in one fundamental respect; the earthly
wave would be seen to travel from equator to pole,
while the Arian travels from pole to equator. Though
clearly seasonal in character, both of them, the transformations
would be opposite in action. Some other
cause, then, must be at work from what we are familiar
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_341' id='Page_341'>341</a></span>
with on earth. This other cause is the presence or
absence of moisture.</p>

<p class='c008' >Two factors are necessary to the begetting of vegetal
life, the raw material and the reacting agent. Oxygen,
nitrogen, water, and a few salts make up the first desideratum,
the sun supplies the second. Unless both
be present, the quickening to life never comes. Now,
the one may be there and the other not, or the other
there and the one not. On earth the material including
water is, except in certain destitute localities,
always present; the sun it is that periodically withdraws.
Observant upon the return of the sun is therefore
the annual recurrence of vegetal growth.</p>

<p class='c008' >On Mars, on the contrary, water is lacking. This
we now know conclusively from other phenomena the
disk presents which have no connection with the present
investigation and are, therefore, unprejudiced witnesses
to the fact. No permanent bodies of water stud its surface.
That the so-called seas are traversed by dark
lines permanent in place is one of several proofs of this.
The only surface water the planet knows comes from
the melting of its polar caps. Vegetation cannot start
until this water reaches it. Consequently, though the
sun be ready, vegetation must wait upon the coming
of the water, and starting from near the pole follow
the frugal flood equatorward.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, such contrariety of progression to what we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_342' id='Page_342'>342</a></span>
should observe in the case of the earth could we view
it from afar is exactly what the curves of visibility of
the canals exhibit. Timed primarily, not to the return
of the sun but to the advent of the water, vegetal
quickening there follows, not the former up the latitudes
but the latter down the disk. For better understanding,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_343' id='Page_343'>343</a></span>
the two curves of phenological quickening,
the mundane and the Martian, are shown in the diagrams.
The plates represent the surfaces of the two
planets, that of the earth being shown upside down with
south at the top so as to agree with the telescopic depiction
of the topography of Mars. The stars mark the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_344' id='Page_344'>344</a></span>
epoch of the dead-point of vegetation at successive
latitudes; the time increasing toward the right. The
curves, it will be noticed, are bowed in opposite ways.
The bowed effect is due in part to Mercator’s projection;
in part it may represent a real decrease in speed
with time. But what is strikingly noticeable is the
opposite character of the advance to the right, the one
curve running up the disk, the other down it. This
shows that the development of vegetation proceeded in
opposite directions over the surface.</p>

<p class='c008' >Thus is the opposed action upon the two planets
accounted for, and we are led to the conclusion that
the canals are strips of vegetation fed by water from
the polar caps, and that the floral seasons there as
affecting the canals are conditioned, not as they would
be with us, directly upon the return of the sun, but indirectly
so through its direct effect upon the polar snows.</p>

<p class='c008' >Once adventured on the idea of vegetation, we find
that it explains much more than the time taken
by the wave of canal-development down the disk. It
accounts at once for the behavior of the canals in the
three northern zones: the polar, arctic, and sub-arctic.
The mean cartouches of these three zones dip down
at their latter end instead of rising there, as is the case
with the cartouches of the mean canals farther south.
This dip denotes that the most northern canals were
waning already by the middle of their August, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_345' id='Page_345'>345</a></span>
the others showed no such tendency; while the date of
the deposition of the frost in these northern latitudes
shows that they were started upon their course toward
extinction before the snow itself had covered them. In
other words, they were not obliterated but snuffed out.
That their decline was thus preparatory to the coming
of the first snowfall or frost-fall, sufficiently severe to
whiten the ground so that it did not melt the next
day, is suggestive of their constitution. It is clear
that they were not abruptly cut off by the frost, but
were timed by nature to such extinction. Vegetation
would behave in just this way, since evolution would
accommodate the career of a plant to its environment.</p>

<p class='c008' >The first question to present itself chronologically in
the canals’ annual history is connected with the size
of the cap. Unfortunately for the simplicity of the
phenomena, the cap is not an extensionless source of
flow, but an extended surface melting from the outer
edge in. It would seem, therefore, that water liberated
from the outer parts should have an effect before the
main body of it were ready to begin its general march
down the disk. There should be, one would think,
at least a partial action, locally, before the main action
got under way. Now, there are certain canals that
show cartouches increasing apparently from the time
observations began, and the most pronounced is the
Jaxartes, which lies of all the canals observed the farthest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_346' id='Page_346'>346</a></span>
north. Now, the cartouches were founded on canals
quickened from the north polar cap. The farther north
the canal, therefore, the greater the likelihood of its
showing the phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008' >That we note such canals is therefore not only not
subversive, but actually corroboratory, of the law it
seems at first to shake. That all the canals of these
zones do not show a like cartouche-profile is not necessary,
a part of them being dependent, not upon the
earlier, but upon the later liberated flow, and thus partaking
in the general law, which grows uniform lower
down the latitudes.</p>

<p class='c008' >As the action from one polar cap proceeds, not only
down to the equator, but across it into the planet’s
other hemisphere, it appears that much, at least, of the
surface of Mars has two seasons of vegetal growth, the
one quickened of the north polar cap, the other of
the southern. How far the polar spheres of action
overlap it is not possible at present to affirm, as the
canals at this opposition were only visible to 35° south
latitude. That the north polar quickening goes down
so far is vouched for, and it is probable from other
observed phenomena that it goes farther.</p>

<p class='c008' >The alternate semi-annual quickening also discloses
itself directly in the cartouches; the previous semestral
growth from the south polar cap actually showing in
them before the impulse from the north began. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_347' id='Page_347'>347</a></span>
slow falling of their curves to the minimum preceding
their later rise is nothing less than the dying out of the
effect started six months before from the south. The
gentler gradient of their fall proclaims a gradual lapse,
just as the subsequent sharper rise points to the advent
of a fresh impulse. And this deduction seems to be
borne out by another circumstance. There is some
evidence of decrease in the pre-minimal gradient southward.
This is telling testimony to the source whence
the impulse came. For if it originated at the south and
traveled northward, the southern canals would be the
first to be affected and the first to die out, and thus
show a longer dead season, exhibited in the cartouches
as a more level stretch.</p>

<p class='c008' >Lastly, the explanation of the canals as threads of
vegetation fays in with the one which has been found to
meet the requirements of the blue-green areas; while
the fact that they prove to develop as they do, reversely
to what would take place on earth, is exactly
what all we have latterly learnt about the surface conditions
of the planet would lead us to expect.</p>

<p class='c008' >From what has just been said we see that the latest
observations at Flagstaff confirm the earlier ones, and,
what is especially corroborative, they do so along another
line. The former were chiefly static, the latter kinematic.
In other words, the behavior of the canals in action
bears out the testimony of their appearance at rest.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Study of the fundamental features of Martian
topography has disclosed, as we have seen, the
existence of vegetation on the planet as the only rational
explanation of the dark markings there, considered
not simply on the score of their appearance
momentarily, but judged by the changes that appearance
undergoes at successive seasons of the Martian
year. Thus we are assured that plant life exists on the
planet. We are made aware of the fact in more ways
than one, but most unanswerably for that trait to which
vegetation owes its very name,—its periodic quickening
to life. Thus the characteristic which has seemed
here most distinctive of this phase of the organic, so
that man even christened it in accordance, has proved
equally telltale there.</p>

<p class='c008' >Important as a conclusion this is no less pregnant as
a premise. For the assurance that plant life exists on
Mars leads to a further step in extramundane acquaintance
of far-reaching import. It introduces us at once
to the probability of life there of a higher and more
immediately appealing kind, not with the vagueness of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_349' id='Page_349'>349</a></span>
general analogy, but with the definiteness of specific
deduction. For the presence of a flora is itself ground
for suspecting a fauna.</p>

<p class='c008' >Of a bond connecting the two we get our first hint
the moment we look inquiringly into the world about
us, that of our own earth. Common experience witnesses
to a coexistence which grows curious and compelling
as we consider it. For it is not confined to life
of any special order, but extends through the whole
range of organisms of both kinds from the lowest to the
highest. Algæ and monera, orchid and mammal, occur
side by side and with a certain considerate poverty
or richness, as the case may be. Luxuriance in the one
is matched by abundance in the other; while a scanty
flora means a poor fauna. This of which we have been
aware in regions round about us from childhood grows
in universality as we explore. Wherever man penetrates
out of his proper sphere he finds the same dual
possession of the land or the sea, and a similar curtailing
or expanding of both tenantries together. No
mountain top so cold but that if it grow plants, it supports
insects and animals, too, after its kind; no desert
so arid but that creeping things find it as possible a
habitat as life that does not stir. Even in almost
boiling geysers animalcula and confervæ share and
share alike. Only where extreme conditions preclude
the one do they equally debar the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_350' id='Page_350'>350</a></span>
Proceeding now from the fact to its factors we perceive
reasons for this tenure in common of the land by
the vegetal and animal kingdoms. Examination proves
the two great divisions of the organic to be inextricably
connected. It strikes our notice first in the relation
of plants to animals. It is of everyday notoriety that
animals eat plants, though it is less universally understood
that in the ultimate they exist on nothing else.
Plants furnish the food of animals; not as a matter of
partial preference but of fundamental necessity. For
the plant is the indispensable intermediary in the process
of metabolism. Without plants animals would
soon cease to exist, since they are unable to manufacture
their own plasm out of the raw material offered by inorganic
nature. They must make it out of the already
prepared plasm of plants or out of other animals who
have made it from plants. So that in the end it all
comes back to plant production. The plant is able to
build its plasm out of chemical substances; the animal
cannot, except in the case of the nitro-bacteria, begin
thus at the lowest rung of the alimentary ladder.</p>

<p class='c008' >But the converse of this dependence is also largely
true. Plants are beholden to animals for processes
that in return make their own life possible. The latter
minister to the former with unconscious service all the
time, and with no more arrogant independence than do
our domestics generally nowadays. The inconspicuous
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_351' id='Page_351'>351</a></span>
earthworm is the fieldhand of nature’s crops, who gets
his own living by making theirs. Without this day
and night laborer the soil for want of stirring had
remained less capable of grass. Above ground it is the
same story. Deprived of the ministrations of insects
many kinds of plants would incontinently perish. By
the solicited visits of bees and other hymenoptera—what
generically may be classed by the layman as
flutter-bys—is the plant’s propagation made possible.
Peculiarly well named, indeed, are the hymenoptera,
seeing that they are the great matrimonial go-betweens,
carrying pollen from one individual to another and thus
uniting what otherwise could not meet. Spectacular
as this widespread commerce is, it forms but portion of
the daily drama in which animals and plants alike take
part. From forthright bargainings of honey for help,
we pass to less direct but no less effective alliance where
plants are beholden to animals for life by the killing
of their enemies or the weeding-out of their competitors,
and from this to generic furtherance where the interdependence
becomes broadcast. In the matter of
metabolism the advantage is not all upon one side.
In the katabolic process of that which each discards
are the two classes of life mutually complimentary,—the
waste of the one being the want of the other,—carbonic
acid gas being given off by the animal, oxygen
by the plant. In biologic economy it is daily more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_352' id='Page_352'>352</a></span>
demonstrable that both are necessary constituents to
an advancing whole, and that each pays for what it gets
by what it gives in return.</p>

<p class='c008' >That they are thus ancillary as well as coexistent today
leads us to confront for them a community of origin
in the past; and further study confirms the inference.
Both paleontology and entomology, or the science of
the aged and the science of the young, prove such ancestry
to be a fact. By going back from the present
into the past, or, what amounts to substantially the
same thing, by descending in the scale of life to the
lowest known forms of organism, we find proof of concomitance,
cogent because congenital. At the time
when inorganic chemical compounds first passed by
evolution into organic ones, the change was of so general
a character that even such tardy representatives of it
as survive today tax erudition to tell to which of the
two great kingdoms they belong, the vegetal or the
animal. Simplest and most primitive of known organisms
are the chromacea, unnucleated single cells as
Haeckel has shown, and next to them in order come
many of the bacteria, also of simple unnucleated plasm.
So little do the majority of the bacteria differ morphologically
from the chromacea, that on the score of
structure the two are not to be catalogued apart. Both
are as elemental as anything well can be, which only
their diet serves to divide. Each is an organism without
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_353' id='Page_353'>353</a></span>
organs, thus belying the dictionary definition of
both animals and plants. Etymologically they are not
organic yet manifestly are alive, and only in their action
are unlike. The chromacea are plasm-forming beings,
and therefore they are plants; the bacteria are plasm-eating
beings, and so are animals. Even this distinction
is not always preserved. As Haeckel tells us:
“the nitro-bacteria which dwell in the earth having the
vegetal property of converting ammonia by oxidation
into nitrous acid and this into nitric acid, using as their
source of carbon the carbonic acid gas of the atmosphere.
They feed, like the chromacea, on simple inorganic
compounds.” Here, then, we have, close to
the threshold of organic life, unorganized organisms,
roughly speaking coeval and differing in a sense but
little, either of them, from inorganic crystals; and yet
the one is an animal, the other a plant. Progenitors
of the two great divisions of life, they were themselves
concomitantly evolved, either side by side or as offshoots
both of a common stock. Now, if the ancestors of the
two great organic kingdoms were thus simultaneously
produced here, we are warranted in believing that they
would similarly be produced elsewhere, given conditions
suitably alike. In consequence, if we detect the presence
of the one, we already have an argument for inferring
the other. Not to complete our syllogism would
be to flaunt a lack of logic in nature’s face.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_354' id='Page_354'>354</a></span>
Rationally viewed, then, the general problem of life
in other worlds reduces itself to a question of conditions.
Since certain physical results follow inevitably
upon certain physical premises, if we can assure ourselves
of the proper premises we may look to nature for
their conclusion. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</span></i>, then, the possibility of life
becomes one of habitat. If the environment be
suitable life will ensue. What makes for such a
mediary <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</span></i> is, like most cosmic processes, in its
fundamentals of interesting simplicity; for the production
of a proper nidus depends primarily upon the mere
size of the body parentally concerned. If a planet be
big enough it will inevitably bring forth life, because of
conditions suitable to its generating; if too small it
will remain sterile to the end of time.</p>

<p class='c008' >That size should be the determining factor whether
a planet shall be fecund or barren may seem at first
thought strange. Yet that it is so admits of no rational
doubt. All that we see of bodies about us shows its
truth, and what we have learnt of cosmic process enables
us in some sort to discern why. In order for evolution,
such as we mark it upon the earth, to be possible, the
parent body must have been at one time at a high temperature,
since only under great heat can the primal
processes occur. But for this generation of caloric
the aggregate mass of the particles, the falling together
of which makes the planet, and their stoppage its internal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_355' id='Page_355'>355</a></span>
heat, must be large. The sun’s rays alone are insufficient
to cause the necessary temperature; the heat
must come from within, though it be helped from without.
Even here the action is abetted by a large body.
For a planet to entrap the sun’s rays or even to preserve
its own internal warmth, an atmosphere is needed, and
it takes a large body to retain an atmospheric covering
sufficiently long. Yet without it not only would there
be no suitable state, but no medium in which organic
or even inorganic reactions could go on. Lastly,
water, the essential nidus for the organism’s early
stages, has its presence similarly conditioned. For this,
like the atmosphere, would from a small body speedily
vanish away. Thus the planet itself is the life-producing
body, although the sun furthers the process
when once begun.</p>

<p class='c008' >That the needed substances are planetarily present,
what we know of the distribution of matter astronomically
sufficiently attests. What we find in meteorites
shows that the catastrophe which preceded our present
solar system’s birth scattered its elemental constituents
throughout its domain, and thus when they came to
be gathered up again into planets that these must have
been materially the same. The manner, not the matter,
then, is alone that about which we are concerned.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, if the mass of matter gravitating together to
form a planet be sufficient to produce the proper inorganic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_356' id='Page_356'>356</a></span>
conditions, the organic must follow as a matter of
course. That the organic springs from the inorganic
is not only shown by what has taken place on earth,
but is the necessary logical deduction from its decay
back into the inorganic again. As Nägeli admirably
observes: “The origin of the organic from the inorganic
is, in the first place, not a question of experience
and experiment, but a fact deduced from the law of
the constancy of matter and force. If all things in the
material world are causally related, if all phenomena
proceed on natural principles, organisms which are
formed of and decay into the same matter must have
been derived originally from inorganic compounds.”</p>

<p class='c008' >The original oneness of the two, the fact that the
organic sprang from the inorganic, is shown by the
cousinly closeness of the lowest organic with the highest
inorganic substances. The monera are suggestive
of crystals in their uniformity of structure. Both
are homogeneous or approximately so. Again, both
grow by taking from what they come in contact with
that which they find suitable and so add to their body
by homogeneous accretion. Finally, when grown too
large for single life, they part into similar crystals or
split into identical cells. The difference between the
division of the crystal and the fission of the cell is
small in kind; much less than that later differentiation
in genesis into parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_357' id='Page_357'>357</a></span>
Yet here we unhesitatingly trace an assured relationship.
It were straining at a gnat to swallow a
camel to doubt it in the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >Just as the two behave analogically alike in their
own action, so do they observe a like attitude toward
nature. They thus point to their common origin.
The monera are resemblant of chemical compounds in
their superiority to external influences. To outward
conditions of temperature and humidity the chromacea
are much as sticks and stones. Some species may remain
for long frozen in ice, Haeckel observes, and yet
wake to activity so soon as it thaws. Others may be
completely desiccated, and then resume their life when
put in water after a lapse of several years. Thus both
in their deathlike lives and in their living immortality
the chromacea are close to inorganic things.</p>

<p class='c008' >From preference, however, these lowest forms of life
affect what to us would be unbearable temperatures.
Many of the chromacea live in hot springs at temperatures
of 123° to 176° Fahrenheit, in which no other,
that is, no higher, organism can dwell. This choice of
habitat is in line with the other details of their evolutionary
career. For it, too, is in keeping with the conditions
of crystalline growth, halfway as it were on the
road to them; the forming of crystals beginning at a
temperature higher still. And we perceive from it
that the passing of the inorganic into the organic is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_358' id='Page_358'>358</a></span>
brought about by a lowering of the temperature of the
parent planet. This again, is in line with the evolution
of chemical complexity. Let the heat become less,
and higher and higher chemical compounds, finally
the organic ones, become possible. That evolution is
nothing else than such a gradually increasing chemical
synthesis is forced on one by study of the facts. Once
started, life, as paleontology shows, develops along
both the floral and the faunal lines side by side, taking
on complexity with time. It begins so soon as secular
cooling has condensed water vapor to its liquid state;
chromacea and confervæ coming into being high up
toward the boiling-point. Then, with lowering temperature
come the seaweeds and the rhizopods, then
the land plants and the lunged vertebrates. Hand in
hand the fauna and flora climb to more intricate perfecting,
life rising as temperature lowers.</p>

<p class='c008' >We perceive then that, considered <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i>, the possibility
of life on a planet is merely a question of the
planet’s size; and then pursuantly that the character
of that life is a matter of the planet’s age. But age
again is a question of size. For the smaller its mass the
quicker the body cools, and with a planet, growing cold
means growing old. Within the bounds that make life
possible, the smaller the body the quicker it ages and
the more advanced its denizens must be. Just how far
the advance goes we may not assert dogmatically in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_359' id='Page_359'>359</a></span>
a given case, since not relative age alone but absolute
time as well is concerned in it. It may be that nature’s
processes cannot be hurried, and that for want of time
development may in part be missed. But from general
considerations the limit of the time needed seems well
within most planetary careers.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, the aspect of the surface of Mars shows that
both these conditions have been fulfilled. Mars is
large enough to have begotten vegetation and small
enough to be already old. All that we know of the
physical state of the planet points to the possibility
of both vegetal and animal life existing there, and furthermore,
that this life should be of a relatively high
order is possible. Nothing contradicts this, and the
observations of the last ten years have rendered the
conclusion then advanced only the more conclusive.
Even the evidence of the past state of the planet confirms
that given by its present one. That with us life
came out of the seas finds its possible parallel in the
fact that seas seem once to have existed there, leaving
their mark discernible to-day. Life, then, had there as
here the wherewith to begin. That we find air and
water in both shows that it had the means to continue
once begun. That it then ran a like course is further
witnessed by what we now detect. The necessary
premises, then, are there. More than this. One half
of the conclusion, vegetal life, gives evidence of itself.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >Of the existence of animal life upon a far planet
any evidence must, of necessity, assume a different
guise from what its flora would present. Plant life
should be, as on Mars we perceive it is, recognizable
as part and parcel of the main features of the planet’s
face. In no such forthright manner could we expect
an animal revelation. The sort of testimony which
would render the one patent would leave the other
obstinately hid.</p>

<p class='c008' >So long as animate life was in the lowest sense animal,
it would not be seen at all, though it were as widespread
as the vegetal life all about it. Reason for this
lies in their receptive character. Plants are fixtures;
where they start they stay; while from the nature of
their food, derived directly from the soil and from the
air, and conditioned chiefly by warmth and moisture,
like forms inhabit large areas and by their massed effect
make far impression. With animals it is otherwise.
They feed by forage, from beetle to buffalo, roaming the
land for sustenance. Thus, both for paucity of number
and from not abiding in one stay they must escape notice
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_361' id='Page_361'>361</a></span>
at a distance such that as individuals they fail to show;
to say nothing of the fact that the flora usually overtop
the fauna, and so help to hide the latter while appearing
itself distinct. Any far view of our earth gives instance
of this. Seen from some panoramic height,
forest and moorland lie patently outspread to view, yet
imagination is taxed to believe them tenanted at all.
Unless man have marred the landscape not a sign
appears of any living thing. One must be near indeed
to note even such unusual sights as a herd of buffalo
in the plains or those immense flights of pigeons, that
in former years occurred like clouds darkening the air.
From the standpoint of another planet, through any such
direct showing animal existence would still remain unknown.</p>

<p class='c008' >Not until the creatures had reached a certain phase
in evolution would their presence become perceptible;
and not then directly, but by the results such presence
brought to pass. Occupancy would be first evidenced
by its imprint on the land; discernible thus initially
not so much by the bodily as by the mind’s eye. For
not till the animal had learnt to dominate nature and
fashion it to his needs and ends would his existence
betray itself. By the transformation he wrought in
the landscape would he be known. It is thus we
should make our own far acquaintance; and by the
disarrangement of nature first have inkling of man.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_362' id='Page_362'>362</a></span>
That it is thus we should betray ourselves, a consideration
of man’s history will show. While he still remained
of savage simplicity, a mere child of nature, he
might come and go unmarked by an outsider, but so
soon as he started in to possess the earth his handicraft
would reveal him. From the moment he bethought
him to till the ground, he entered upon a course of
world-subjugation of which we cannot foresee the end;
but he has already advanced far enough to give us an
idea of the process. It began with agriculture. Deforestation
with its subsequent quartering of crops
signalized his acquisition of real estate. His impress
at first was sporadic and irregular, and in so far followed
that of nature itself; but as it advanced it took
on a methodism of plan. Husbandry begot thrift,
and augmented wants demanded an increasing return
for toil; and to this desirable end systematization became
a necessity. At the same time gregariousness
grew and still further emphasized the need for economy
of space and time. In part unconsciously, man learnt
the laws that govern the expenditure of force and more
and more consciously applied them. Geometry, unloosed
of Euclid, became a part of everyday life as insidiously
as M. Jourdain found that he had been talking
prose. Regularity rules to-day, to the lament of art.
The railroad is straighter than the turnpike, as that is
straighter than the trail. Communication is now too
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_363' id='Page_363'>363</a></span>
urgent in its demands to know anything but law and
take other than the shortest path to its destination.
Tillage has undergone a like rectification. To one used
to the patchwork quilting of the crops in older lands
the methodical rectangles of the farms of the Great
West are painfully exact. Yet it is more than probable
that these material manifestations would be the first
signs of intelligence to one considering the earth from
far. Our towns would in all likelihood constitute the
next; and, lastly, the great arteries of travel that minister
to their wants. Their scale, too, would render
them the first objects to be observed. Farming as now
practiced in Kansas or Dakota gives it a certain cosmical
concern; fields for miles turning in hue with the
rhythm of the drilled should impress an eye, if armed
with our appliances, many millions of miles away.</p>

<p class='c008' >Even now we should know ourselves cosmically by
our geometrical designs. To interplanetary understanding
it is this quality that would speak. Still more
so will it tell as time goes on. As yet we are but at the
beginning of our subjugation of the globe. We have
hardly explored it all, still less occupied it. When we
do so, and space shall have become enhancedly precious,
directness of purpose with economy of result will have
partitioned so regularly the surface of the earth as to
impart to it an artificiality of appearance, and it becomes
one vast coördinated expanse subservient entirely to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_364' id='Page_364'>364</a></span>
the wants of its possessors. Centres of population
and lines of communication, with tillage carried on in
the most economic way; to this it must come in the
end.</p>

<p class='c008' >Nor is this outcome in any sense a circumstance accidental
to the earth; it is an inevitable phase in the evolution
of organisms. As the organism develops brain
it is able to circumvent the adversities of condition;
and by overcoming more pronounced inhospitality of
environment not only to survive but spread. Evidence
of this thought will be stamped more and more
visibly upon the face of its habitat. On earth, for
all our pride of intellect, we have not yet progressed
very far from the lowly animal state that leaves no records
of itself. It is only in the last two centuries that
our self-registration upon our surroundings has been
marked. With another planet the like course must in
all probability be pursued, and the older the life relatively
to its habitat the more its signs of occupation
should show. Intelligence on other worlds could then
only make its presence known by such material revelation,
and the sign-manuals of itself would appear more
artificial in look as that life was high in rank. Given
the certainty of plant-life, such markings are what one
would look to find. Criticism which refuses to credit
detail of the sort because too bizarre to be true writes
itself down as unacquainted with the character of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_365' id='Page_365'>365</a></span>
problem. For it is precisely such detail which should
show if any evidence at all were forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c008' >If, now, we turn our inquiry to Mars, we shall be
fairly startled at what its disk discloses. For we find
ourselves confronted in the canals and oases by precisely
the appearances <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> reasoning proves should
show were the planet inhabited. Our abstract prognostications
have taken concrete form. Here in these
rectilineal lines and roundish spots we have spread out
our centres of effort and our lines of communication.
For the oases are clearly ganglia to which the canals
play the part of nerves. The strange geometricism
which proves inexplicable on any other hypothesis now
shows itself of the essence of the solution. The appearance
of artificiality cast up at the phenomena in
disproof vindicates itself as the vital point in the whole
matter. Like the cachet of an architect, it is the thing
about the building that established the authorship.</p>

<p class='c008' >Though the Earth and Mars agree in being planets,
they differ constitutionally in several important respects.
Even to us the curious network that enshrouds
the Martian disk suggests handicraft; it
implies it much more when considered from a Martian
standpoint.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >That the canals and oases are of artificial origin
is thus suggested by their very look; when we
come to go further and inquire into what may be their
office in the planet’s economy, we find that the idea in
addition to its general probability now acquires particular
support. For this we are indebted in part to
study of their static aspect, but chiefly to what has
been learnt of their kinematic action.</p>

<p class='c008' >Dearth of water is the key to their character. Water
is very scarce on the planet. We know this by the
absence of any bodies of it of any size upon the surface.
So far as we can see the only available water is what
comes from the semi-annual melting at one or the other
cap of the snow accumulated there during the previous
winter. Beyond this there is none except for what
may be present in the air. Now, water is absolutely
essential to all forms of life; no organisms can exist
without it.</p>

<p class='c008' >But as a planet ages, it loses its oceans as has before
been explained, and gradually its whole water supply.
Life upon its surface is confronted by a growing scarcity
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_367' id='Page_367'>367</a></span>
of this essential to existence. For its fauna to survive
it must utilize all it can get. To this end it would be
obliged to put forth its chief endeavors, and the outcome
of such work would result in a deformation of the
disk indicative of its presence. Lines of communication
for water purposes, between the polar caps, on the
one hand, and the centres of population, on the other,
would be the artificial markings we should expect to
perceive.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, it is not a little startling that the semblance of
just such signs of intelligent interference with nature is
what we discern on the face of Mars,—in the canals
and oases. So dominant in its mien is the pencil-like
directness of the canals as to be the trait that primarily
strikes an unprejudiced observer who beholds this astounding
system of lines under favorable definition
for the first time, and its impressiveness only grows
on him with study of the phenomena. That they
suggested rule and compass, Schiaparelli said of them
long ago, without committing himself as to what they
were. In perception the great observer was, as usual,
quite right; and the better they are seen the more they
justify the statement. Punctilious in their precision,
they outdo in method all attempts of freehand drawing
to copy them. Often has the writer tried to represent
the regularity he saw, only to draw and redraw his lines
in vain. Nothing short of ruling them could have
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_368' id='Page_368'>368</a></span>
reproduced what the telescope revealed. Strange
as their depiction may look in the drawings, the
originals look stranger still. Indeed, that they should
look unnatural when properly depicted is not unnatural
if they are so in fact. For it is the geodetic precision
which the lines exhibit that instantly stamps them
to consciousness as artificial. The inference is so
forthright as to be shared by those who have not
seen them to the extent of instant denial of their
objectivity. Drawings of them look too strange to be
true. So scepticism imputes to the draughtsman
their artificial fashioning, not realizing that by so doing
it bears unconscious witness to their character. For
in order to disprove the deduction it is driven to deny
the fact. Now the fact can look after itself and will
be recognized in time. For that the lines are as I have
stated is beyond doubt. Each return of the planet
shows them more and more geometric as sites are
bettered and training improves.</p>

<p class='c008' >Suggestive of design as their initial appearance is,
the idea of artificiality receives further sanction from
more careful consideration, even from a static point
of view, on at least eight counts:—</p>

<p class='c008' >1. Their straightness;</p>

<p class='c008' >2. Their individually uniform size;</p>

<p class='c008' >3. Their extreme tenuity;</p>

<p class='c008' >4. The dual character of some of them;</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_369' id='Page_369'>369</a></span>
5. Their position with regard to the planet’s fundamental
features;</p>

<p class='c008' >6. Their relation to the oases;</p>

<p class='c008' >7. The character of these spots; and, finally,</p>

<p class='c008' >8. The systematic networking by both canals and
spots of the whole surface of the planet.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, no natural phenomena within our knowledge
show such regularity on such a scale upon any one of
these eight counts, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i> upon all. When one considers
that these lines run for thousands of miles in an
unswerving direction, as far relatively as from London
to Bombay, and as far actually as from Boston to San
Francisco, the inadequacy of natural explanation
becomes glaring.</p>

<p class='c008' >These several counts become more expressive of design
the farther one looks into them. Straightness
upon a sphere means the following of an arc of a great
circle. The lines, then, are arcs of great circles. Now,
the great circle course is the shortest distance connecting
two given points. The canals of Mars, then, practice
this economy; they connect their terminals by
the shortest, that is, other things equal, by the quickest
and least wasteful path. Their preserving a uniform
width throughout this distance is an equally unnatural
feature for any natural action to exhibit, but
a perfectly natural one for an unnatural agent. For
means of communication for whatever cause would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_370' id='Page_370'>370</a></span>
probably be fashioned of like countenance throughout.
Their extreme tenuity is a third trait pointing to artificiality;
inasmuch as the narrower they are, the
more probable is their construction by local intelligence.
Even more inexplicable, except from intent,
is their dual character. For them to parallel one
another like the twin rails of a railway track, seems
quite beyond the powers of natural causation. Enigmatic,
indeed, from a natural standpoint, they cease
to be so enigmatic viewed from an artificial one; and
this the more by reason of what has lately been learnt
of the character of their distribution. That they are
found most plentifully near the equator, where the latitudinal
girth is greatest, and thence diminish in numbers
to about latitude 60°, where they disappear,—and
this not relatively to the amount of surface but
actually,—is very significant. It is quite incapable of
natural explanation, and can only be accounted for
on some theory of design such as lines of communication,
or canals conducting water down the latitudes for
distribution. So that this distribution of the doubles
is in keeping with the law of development disclosed
by the canals <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>. Channels and return-channels
the two lines of the pair may be, but about this we can
at present posit nothing. The relation may be of
still greater complexity, and we must carefully distinguish
between surmise and deduction.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_371' id='Page_371'>371</a></span>
The position of the canals, with regard to the main
features of the disk, has a cogency of its own, an argument
from time. The places from which the lines start
and to which they go are such as to imply a dependence
of the latter upon the former chronologically. The
lines are logically superposed upon the natural features;
not as if they had grown there, but as if they had been
placed there for topographic cause. Those termini
are used which we should ourselves select for stations
of intercommunication. For the lines not only leave
important geodetic points, but they travel directly
to equally salient ones.</p>

<p class='c008' >The connection of the canals with the oases is no less
telltale of intent. The spots are found only at junctions,
clearly the seal and sanction of such rendezvous.
Their relation to the canals that enter them bespeaks
method and design. Centring single lines, they are
inclosed by doubles, a disposition such as would be
true did they hold a pivotal position in the planet’s
economy.</p>

<p class='c008' >The shape of the oases also suggests significance.
Their form is round, a solid circle of shading of so deep
a tone as to seem black, although undoubtedly in truth
blue-green. Now, a circular area has this peculiar
property, that it incloses for a given length of perimeter
the maximum of space. Any other area has a longer
inclosing boundary for the surface inclosed. Considering
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_372' id='Page_372'>372</a></span>
each area to be made up of onion-like envelops
to an original core, each similar in shape to the kernel,
we see that the property in question means that the
average distance for points of the circular area from
the centre is less than the same distance for those of
any other figure. This has immediate bearing on the
possible fashioning of such areas. For sufficient intelligence
in the fashioners would certainly lead to a construction,
where the greatest area could be attended to
at the least expenditure of force. This would be where
the distance to be traveled from the centre to all the
desired points was on the average least; that is, the
area would be round.</p>

<p class='c008' >But last and all-embracing in its import is the system
which the canals form. Instead of running at haphazard,
the canals are interconnected in a most remarkable
manner. They seek centres instead of avoiding
them. The centres are linked thus perfectly one with
another, an arrangement which could not result from
centres, whether of explosion or otherwise, which were
themselves discrete. Furthermore, the system covers
the whole surface of the planet, dark areas and light
ones alike, a world-wide distribution which exceeds
the bounds of natural possibility. Any force which
could act longitudinally on such a scale must be limited
latitudinally in its action, as witness the belts of Jupiter
or the spots upon the sun. Rotational, climatic, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_373' id='Page_373'>373</a></span>
other physical cause could not fail of zonal expression.
Yet these lines are grandly indifferent to such compelling
influences. Finally, the system after meshing the
surface in its entirety runs straight into the polar caps.</p>

<p class='c008' >It is, then, a system whose end and aim is the tapping
of the snow-cap for the water there semiannually
let loose; then to distribute it over the planet’s face.</p>

<p class='c008' >Function of this very sort is evidenced by the look
of the canals. Further study during the last eleven
years as to their behavior leads to a like conclusion,
while at the same time it goes much farther by revealing
the action in the case. This action proves to be
not only in accord with the theory, but interestingly
explanatory of the process.</p>

<p class='c008' >In the first place, the canals have shown themselves,
as they showed to Schiaparelli, to be seasonal phenomena.
This negatives afresh the possibility of their
being cracks. But furthermore, their seasonal behavior
turns out to follow a law quite different from
what we know on earth and betokens that they are indebted
to the melting of the polar cap for their annual
growth, even more directly than to the sun, and that
vegetation is the only thing that satisfactorily accounts
for their conduct. But again this is not all. Their
time of quickening proceeds with singular uniformity
down the disk, not only to, but <em>across the equator</em>.
Now, this last fact has peculiar significance.</p>

<p class='c008' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_374' id='Page_374'>374</a></span>
So large are the planetary masses that no substance
can resist the strains due to the cosmic forces acting
on them to change their shape till it becomes one of
stable equilibrium. Thus a body of planetary size,
if unrotating, becomes a sphere except for solar tidal
deformation; if rotating, it takes on a spheroidal form
exactly expressive, as far as observation goes, of the so-called
centrifugal force at work. Mars presents such
a figure, being flattened out to correspond to its axial
rotation. Its surface, therefore, is in fluid equilibrium,
or, in other words, a particle of liquid at any
point of its surface at the present time would stay
where it was, devoid of inclination to move elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, the water which quickens the verdure of the
canals moves from the neighborhood of the pole down
to the equator as the season advances. This it does,
then, irrespective of gravity. No natural force propels
it, and the inference is forthright and inevitable that it
is artificially helped to its end. There seems to be no
escape from this deduction. Water flows only downhill,
and there is no such thing as downhill on a surface
already in fluid equilibrium. A few canals might presumably
be so situated that their flow could, by inequality
of terrane, lie equatorward, but not all. As we
see on the earth, rivers flow impartially to all points of
the compass, dependent only upon unevenness of the
local surface conditions. Now, it is not in particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_375' id='Page_375'>375</a></span>
but by general consent that the canal system of Mars
develops from pole to equator.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the respective times at which the minima take
place, it appears that the canal-quickening occupies
fifty-two days, as evidenced by the successive vegetal
darkenings to descend from latitude 72° north to latitude
0°, a journey of 2650 miles. This gives for the
water a speed of fifty-one miles a day, or 2.1 miles an
hour. The rate of progression is remarkably uniform;
and this abets the deduction as to assisted transference.
The simple fact that it is carried from near the pole to
the equator is sufficiently telltale of extrinsic aid, but
the uniformity of the action increases its significance.</p>

<p class='c008' >But the fact is more unnatural yet. The growth
pays no regard to the equator, but proceeds across it
as if it did not exist into the planet’s other hemisphere.
Here is something still more telling than its travel to
this point. For even if we suppose, for the sake of argument,
that natural forces took the water down to the
equator, their action must there be certainly reversed
and the equator prove a dead-line to pass which were
impossible.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c015'     >That Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort
or other we may consider as certain as it is
uncertain what those beings may be. The theory of the
existence of intelligent life on Mars may be likened to
the atomic theory in chemistry in that in both we are
led to the belief in units which we are alike unable to
define. Both theories explain the facts in their respective
fields and are the only theories that do, while
as to what an atom may resemble we know as little as
what a Martian may be like. But the behavior of
chemic compounds points to the existence of atoms too
small for us to see, and in the same way the aspect and
behavior of the Martian markings implies the action
of agents too far away to be made out.</p>

<p class='c008' >But though in neither case can we tell anything of the
Bodily form of its unit, we can in both predicate a good
deal about their workings. Apart from the general
fact of intelligence implied by the geometric character
of their constructions, is the evidence as to its degree
afforded by the cosmopolitan extent of the action.
Girdling their globe and stretching from pole, to pole,
the Martian canal system not only embraces their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_377' id='Page_377'>377</a></span>
whole world, but is an organized entity. Each canal
joins another, which in turn connects with a third, and
so on over the entire surface of the planet. This continuity
of construction posits a community of interest.
Now, when we consider that though not so large as the
Earth the world of Mars is one of 4200 miles diameter
and therefore containing something like 212,000,000
of square miles, the unity of the process acquires
considerable significance. The supposed vast enterprises
of the earth look small beside it. None of them
but become local in comparison, gigantic as they seem
to us to be.</p>

<p class='c008' >The first thing that is forced on us in conclusion is the
necessarily intelligent and non-bellicose character of
the community which could thus act as a unit throughout
its globe. War is a survival among us from savage
times and affects now chiefly the boyish and unthinking
element of the nation. The wisest realize that there
are better ways for practicing heroism and other and
more certain ends of insuring the survival of the fittest.
It is something a people outgrow. But whether they
consciously practice peace or not, nature in its evolution
eventually practices it for them, and after enough
of the inhabitants of a globe have killed each other off,
the remainder must find it more advantageous to work
together for the common good. Whether increasing
common sense or increasing necessity was the spur
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_378' id='Page_378'>378</a></span>
that drove the Martians to this eminently sagacious
state we cannot say, but it is certain that reached it they
have, and equally certain that if they had not they
must all die. When a planet has attained to the age of
advancing decrepitude, and the remnant of its water
supply resides simply in its polar caps, these can only
be effectively tapped for the benefit of the inhabitants
when arctic and equatorial peoples are at one. Difference
of policy on the question of the all-important
water supply means nothing short of death. Isolated
communities cannot there be sufficient unto themselves;
they must combine to solidarity or perish.</p>

<p class='c008' >From the fact, therefore, that the reticulated canal
system is an elaborate entity embracing the whole planet
from one pole to the other, we have not only proof of
the world-wide sagacity of its builders, but a very suggestive
side-light, to the fact that only a universal necessity
such as water could well be its underlying cause.</p>

<p class='c008' >Possessed of important bearing upon the possibility
of life on Mars is the rather recent appreciation that the
habitat of both plants and animals is conditioned not
by the minimum, nor by the mean temperature of the
locality, but by the maximum heat attained in the region.
Not only is the minimum thermometric point
no determinator of a dead-line, but even a mean temperature
does not measure organic capability. The
reason for this is that the continuance of the species
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_379' id='Page_379'>379</a></span>
seems to depend solely upon the possibility of reproduction,
and this in turn upon a suitable temperature
at the critical period of the plant’s or animal’s career.
Contrary to previous ideas on the subject, Merriam
found this to be the case with the fauna of the San
Francisco Peak region in northern Arizona. The
region was peculiarly fitted for a test, because
of rising a boreal island of life out of a sub-tropic
sea of desert. It thus reproduced along its
flanks the conditions of climates farther north, altitude
taking the part of latitude, one succeeding another
until at the top stood the arctic zone. Merriam
showed that the existence of life there was dependent
solely upon a sufficiency of warmth at the breeding season.
If that were enough the animal or plant propagated
its kind, and held its foothold against adverse
conditions during the rest of the year. This it did
by living during its brief summer and then going into
hibernation the balance of the time. Nature in short
suspended its functions to a large extent for months
together, enabling it to resurrect when the conditions
turned.</p>

<p class='c008' >Hibernation proves thus to be a trait acquired by the
organism in consequence of climatic conditions. Like
all such it can only be developed in time, since nature
is incapable of abrupt transition. An animal suddenly
transported from the tropic to a sub-arctic zone will
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_380' id='Page_380'>380</a></span>
perish, because it has not yet learnt the trick of winter
sleeping. While still characterized by seasonal insomnia
it is incapable of storing its energies and biding
its time. But given time enough to acquire the art,
its existence is determined solely by the enjoyment of
heat enough at some season to permit of the vital possibility
of reproducing its kind.</p>

<p class='c008' >Diurnal shutting off of the heat affects the process
but little, provided the fall be not below freezing at the
hottest season. So much is shown by the fauna of our
arctic and sub-arctic zones, but still more pertinently to
Mars by the zones of the San Francisco Peak region,
since the thinner air of altitude, through which a greater
amount of heat can radiate off, is there substituted
for the thicker one of latitudinally equal isotherms.
Here again with the diurnal as before with the seasonal
it is the maximum, not the mean, or, till low, even the
minimum temperature, that tells.</p>

<p class='c008' >Now, with Mars the state of things is completely in
accord with what is thus demanded for the existence of
life. The Martian climate is one of extremes, where
considerable heat treads on the heels of great cold.
And the one of these two conditions is as certain as the
other, as the condition of the planet’s surface shows
conclusively. In summer and during the day it must
be decidedly hot, certainly well above any possible
freezing, a thinner air blanket actually increasing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_381' id='Page_381'>381</a></span>
amount of heat that reaches the surface, though affecting
the length of time of its retention unfavorably.
The maximum temperature, therefore, cannot be low.
The minimum of course is; but as we have just seen,
it is the maximum that regulates the possibility of life.
In spite, therefore, of a winter probably longer and
colder than our own, organic life is not in the least debarred
from finding itself there.</p>

<p class='c008' >Indeed, the conditions appear to be such as to put a
premium upon life of a high order. The Martian year
being twice as long as our own, the summer is there proportionately
extended. Even in the southern hemisphere,
the one where the summer is the shortest, it
lasts for 158 days, while at the same latitudes our
own is but 90 days. This lengthening of the period of
reproduction cannot but have an elevating effect upon
the organism akin to the prolongation of childhood
pointed out by John Fiske as playing so important a
part in the evolution of the highest animals. Day and
night, on the other hand, alternate there with approximately
the same speed as here, and except for what is
due to a thinner air covering reproduce our own terrestrial
diurnal conditions, which as we saw are not
inimical to life.</p>

<p class='c008' >In this respect, then, Mars proves to be by no means
so bad a habitat. It offers another example of how
increasing knowledge widens the domain that life may
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_382' id='Page_382'>382</a></span>
occupy. Just as we have now found organic existence
in abyssal depths of sea and in excessive degrees of both
heat and cold, so do we find from exploration of our
island mountains, which more than any other locality
on earth facsimile the Martian surface, its possession
there as well.</p>

<p class='c008' >Another point, too, is worth consideration. In an
aging world where the conditions of life have grown
more difficult, mentality must characterize more and
more its beings in order for them to survive, and would
in consequence tend to be evolved. To find, therefore,
upon Mars highly intelligent life is what the planet’s
state would lead one to expect.</p>

<p class='c008' >To some people it may seem that the very strangeness
of Martian life precludes for it an appeal to human
interest. To me this is but a near-sighted view. The
less the life there proves a counterpart of our earthly
state of things, the more it fires fancy and piques inquiry
as to what it be. We all have felt this impulse
in our childhood as our ancestors did before us, when
they conjured goblins and spirits from the vasty void,
and if our energy continue we never cease to feel its
force through life. We but exchange, as our years increase,
the romance of fiction for the more thrilling
romance of fact. As we grow older we demand reality,
but so this requisite be fulfilled the stranger the realization
the better we are pleased. Perhaps it is the more
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_383' id='Page_383'>383</a></span>
vivid imagination of youth that enables us all then to
dispense with the hall-mark of actuality upon our cherished
visions; perhaps a deeper sense of our own oneness
with nature as we get on makes us insist upon getting
the real thing. Whatever the reason be, certain
it is that with the years a narration, no matter how
enthralling, takes added hold of us for being true.
But though we crave this solid foothold for our conceptions,
we yield on that account no jot or tittle of our
interest for the unexpected.</p>

<p class='c008' >Good reason we have for the allurement we feel
toward what is least like us. For the wider the separation
from the familiar, the greater the parallax the new
affords for cosmic comprehension. That which differs
little yields little to the knowledge already possessed.
Just as a longer base line gives us a better measure
of the distance of the sun, so here the more diverse the
aspects, the farther back they push the common starting-point
and furnish proportionately comprehensive
insight into the course by which each came to be what
it is. By studying others we learn about ourselves,
and though from the remote we learn less easily, we
eventually learn the more. Even on the side, then,
that touches most men, the personal, the strangeness
of the subject should to the far-seeing prove all the
greater magnet.</p>

<p class='c008' >One of the things that makes Mars of such transcendent
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_384' id='Page_384'>384</a></span>
interest to man is the foresight it affords of the
course earthly evolution is to pursue. On our own
world we are able only to study our present and our
past; in Mars we are able to glimpse, in some sort, our
future. Different as the course of life on the two
planets undoubtedly has been, the one helps, however
imperfectly, to better understanding of the other.</p>

<p class='c008' >Another, more abstract but no less alluring, appeals
to that desire innate in man to know about the cosmos
of which he forms a part and which we call by the name
of science. Study of Mars responds to this craving
both directly by revelation of the secrets of another
world and indirectly by the bearing of what we thus
learn upon our understanding of the laws of the universe.
For the facts thus acquired broaden our conceptions
in every branch of science. Some day our
own geology, meteorology, and the rest will stand indebted
to study of the planet Mars for advance along
their respective lines. Already the most alert of those
professing them are lending ear to information from
this source, and such cosmopolitanism can but increase
as the years roll on. Today what we already know is
helping to comprehension of another world; in a not
distant future we shall be repaid with interest, and
what that other world shall have taught us will redound
to a better knowledge of our own, and of that
cosmos of which the two form part.</p>
